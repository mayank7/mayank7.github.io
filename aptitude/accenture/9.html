How can he fit Ten horses into nine stables?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>It says the man wants to fit "Ten Horses" into nine stables. There are nine letters in the phrase "Ten Horses". So you can put one letter eachin all nine stables.<br>[T] [E] [N] [H] [O] [R] [S] [E] [S]</font><br><br>86) To move a Safe, two cylindrical steel bars 7 inches in diameter are used as rollers.How far will the safe have moved forward when the rollers have made one revolution?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>diameter = 7cms<br>radius = 7/2 cms<br>circumference = 2*22/7*r<br>= 2*22/7*7/2<br>= 22 cms is the distance moved.</font><br><br>87) Brothers Ramu ,Raju and Rahul are given ropes of equal lengths. They are given a chance by their ailing father that they can own the land that they manage to fence around in father's common land.

At the end, who will manage to acquire most land ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Raju would be the clear winner. This is because for a given perimeter, circle takes the maximum area.</font><br><br>88) Ramu was driving to a city full of mathematicians. There was a distance board reading the number of Kms he has to travel further. It stated that the distance when divided by 2,3,4,5 and 6 leaves a remainder 1. But when divided by 11 it leaves a remainder 0. Help Ramu in knowing the exact distance?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>LCM(2 3 4 5 6)=60<br>60+1=61 not divisible by 11<br>60*2 +1 =121 divisible by 11<br>Answer is 121.</font><br><br>89) Ravi had got twice as much as marks as Ramu. His teacher had made him a promise that, for every mark he scores above Ramu, he would be awarded 50% of those marks as bonus. Find the ratio of his bonus marks to the total marks of Ravi and Ramu ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Lets say Ramu has got x marks.<br>Then Ravi would had got 2x marks initially. But his teacher has promised a bonus of 50% of marks from the extra marks he got more than Ravi.<br>Hence he would be awarded x/2 marks as bonus. Total marks of Ravi = 2x + x/2 = 5x/2.<br>Total marks of both the students = Total marks of Ramu + Total marks of Ravi<br>= x + 5x/2 = 7x/2.<br>Ratio of Ravi's bonus mark to the Total marks of Ravi and Ramu would be (x/2) divided by (7x/2) = 1/7.</font><br><br>90) An elephant fell into a well of depth 20mts. Everyday it climbs 4 mts but at the end falls by 2 mts. Find the number of days it would take for the elephant to get out of the well ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Since it climbs 4 mts and falls by 2 mts everyday, effectively it climbs 2 mts everyday. In 8 days it climbs 16mts.<br>Then on 9th day it climbs by 4 mts and can get out without having to fall back. Hence it takes 9 days for the elephant to be safe.</font><br><br><center><a href="8.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="10.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
