If both of them are correct, when does the birthday of their mother fall?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Dates after 12th August and before 15th August are 13th & 14th August only.<br>Dates after 13th August and before 20th August are 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th & 19th August.<br>As said both are correct, means its Intersection of those two.<br>Its only one date which is 14th August.</font><br><br>52) A person travels through 5 cities - A, B, C, D, E. Cities E is 2 km west of D. D is 3 km north-east of A. C is 5 km north of B and 4 km west of A. If this person visits these citiesin the sequence B - C - A - E - D, what is the effective distance between cities B and D?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Make a diagram, we get<br>Horizontal distance of B and D( Eto w) = 6.12 km<br>Vertical distance of B and D( Nto S) = 7.12 km<br>Direct distance = 9.3 kms</font><br><br>53) The price of petrol is increased by 10%. By how much percent the consumption be reduced so that the expenditure remains the same?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>using formulae [r/(100+r%)]*100, we get 9%.</font><br><br>54) 10 men can complete a piece of work in 15 days and 15 women can complete the same work in 12 days. If all the 10 men and 15 women work together, in how many days will the work get completed?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>In 1 day, 10 men can do 1/15 of the work and 15 women can do 1/12 of the work, so in 1 day working together they would do 1/15 + 1/12 of the work i.e. 3/20 of the work.<br>So it would take 6 days and two-thirds of 7th day.</font><br><br>55) A group of 50 students were required to clear 2 tasks, one in rock-climbing and the other in bridge crossing during an adventure sports expedition. 30 students cleared both the tasks. 37 cleared bridge crossing, 38 students cleared rockclimbing. How many students could not clear any task?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>use the formula P(AUB)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A intersection B)<br>=37+38-30=45<br>but total is 50 therefor required student=50-45=5</font><br><br>56) (3X+2)(2X-5)=AX^2+ KX+N; then what is the value of A-N+K?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>(3x+2)(2x-5)=6x^2-11x-10<br>So,A=6, K=-11, N=-10<br>Finally,<br>A-N+K=6-(-10)+(-11)<br>=6+10-11<br>=5</font><br><br>57) A piece of ribbon 4 yard long is used to make bows requiring 15 inches of ribbon for each. What is the maximum number of bows that can be made?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>1 yard=36 inches<br>4 yard=144 inches,<br>1 bow requires 15inches so 144/15=9<br>so 9 bows can be made.</font><br><br>58) Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight. But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."How much does Meenu weigh?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>It is given that Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her own weight.<br>It means that 29 Kgs is the other half. So she weighs 58 Kgs.<br>Solving mathematically, let's assume that her weight is X Kgs.<br>X = 29 + X/2<br>2*X = 58 + X<br>X = 58 Kgs</font><br><br>59) Consider the sum: ABC + DEF + GHI = JJJ .If different letters represent different digits, and there are no leading zeros, what does J represent?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>The value of J must be 9. Since there are no leading zeros, J must be 7, 8, or 9. (JJJ = ABC + DEF + GHI= 14? + 25? + 36? = 7??)<br>Now, the remainder left after dividing any number by 9 is the same as the remainder left after dividing the sum of the digits of that number by 9.<br>Also, note that 0 + 1 + ... + 9 has a remainder of 0 after dividing by 9 and JJJ has a remainder of 0, 3, or 6.<br>The number 9 is the only number from 7, 8 and 9 that leaves a remainder of 0, 3, or 6 if you remove it from the sum 0 + 1 + ... + 9.<br>Hence, it follows that J must be 9.</font><br><br>60) Consider three brothers Ram, Ravi and Rahul.
