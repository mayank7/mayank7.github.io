The velocity of the stream against John is measured to be 2 Kilometers/hr. Now, how much his effective speed will increase when he swims in the direction of the stream?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Since John opposes the stream speed to achieve an effective speed of 8 Km/hr, original physical speed of John would be 8 + 2 = 10 Kilometers/hr.<br>In downstream, if he swims with his original speed his effective speed will become 10 + 2 = 12 Kilometers/hr.<br>This is 4 Kilometers/hr more than that of the initial effective speed 8 Kilometers/hr.<br>Hence his speed would increase by 4/8 % = 50%.</font><br><br>62) In how many different ways can the letter of the word "ECHRONICLEE" be arranged?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>ECHRONICLEE can be arranged as 11!<br>3E's can be arranged as 3!<br>2c's can be arranged as 2!<br>total=11!/3!x2!=3326400</font><br><br>63) If a shopkeeper accidentally sells a pen at double its actual selling price, his profit increases 4 fold. Then he realizes his mistake and sells other pens at their original selling price. Find his actual profit percentage?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Let the original selling price be sp and the cost price be cp.<br>If he sells the pen at double the selling price, his new profit will be 2sp - cp.<br>His actual profit should had been (sp - cp). But his accidental rising of the selling price resulted in a four fold<br>increase of the original profit which is 4 X (sp - cp).<br>Hence, 2sp - cp = 4 X (sp - cp)<br>Therefore sp = (3/2)cp.<br>Actual profit percentage = (sp - cp)/cp % = 50%</font><br><br>64) A leather box contains 8 black balls and 6 white balls. Two draws of three balls each are made, the balls being replaced after the first draw. What is the probability that the balls were black in the first draw and white in the second draw?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Total number of balls = 8 + 6 = 14<br>Total ways of drawing 3 balls, N(S) = 14C3 = 364<br>No of ways to draw 3 black balls = N(E1) for black balls = 8C3 = 56<br>Probability of all balls being black = P(E1) = N(E1) / N(S) = 56/ 364 = 14/91<br>No of ways to draw 3 white balls = N(E2) for white balls = 6C3 = 20<br>Probability of all balls being white = P(E2) = 20 / 364 = 5/91<br>Probability of drawing 3 black balls in first draw and drawing 3 white balls in the second draw = P(E1) x P(E2) Therefore P(E) = 14/91 x 5/91 = 70 /8281</font><br><br>65) Fourteen persons are sitting around a circular table facing the centre. What is the probability that three particular persons sit together?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>In a circle of n different persons, the total number of arrangements possible = (n - 1)!<br>Total number of arrangements = n(S) = (14 � 1)! = 13 !<br>Taking three persons as a unit, total persons = 12 (in 4 units)<br>Therefore no. of ways for these 12 persons to around the circular table = (12 - 1)! = 11!<br>In any given unit, 3 particular person can sit in 3!. Hence total number of ways that any three person can sit = n(E) = 11! X 3!<br>Therefore P (E) = probability of three persons sitting together = n(E) / n(S) = 11! X 3 ! divided by 13! 3 x 2 divided by 13 x 12 = 1/26</font><br><br>66) The average age of a group of 12 students is 20years. If 4 more students join the group, the average age increases by 1 year.
