If the super fast train doubles its speed, what should be the ratio (approximately) of the speed of passenger train to that of the super fast train so that passenger train S reaches exactly at the scheduled time at station A on that day?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>As per condition , initial ratio of the speed of passenger train to that of the super fast train is 1:4.<br>Initially, passenger train takes 4/5 or 48 mins hr to travel from B to A and superfast train train takes 1/5 hr or 12 mins to reach stn A from Stn B.<br>when On a particular day N leaves for station B from Station A, 20 minutes behind the normal schedule.<br>In order to maintain the schedule both N and S increased their speed. If the super fast train doubles its speed, it covers distance in 6 mins and remains 14 mins behind schedule.<br>To maintain schedule, passenger train has to cover the distance in 48-14 = 34 mins.<br>So final ratio of speeds will be 6:34 or 1:6.</font><br><br>19) Two boys are playing on a ground. Both the boys are less than 10 years old. Age of the younger boy is equal to the cube root of the product of the age of the two boys. If we place the digit representing the age of the younger boy to the left of the digit representing the age of the elder boy, we get the age of the father of the younger boy.<br>Similarly, we place the digit representing the age of the elder boy to the left of the digit representing the age of the younger boy and divide the figure by 2, we get the age of the mother of the younger boy. The mother of the younger boy is younger than his father by 3 years. Then, what is the age of the younger boy?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Assume A is elder and B is younger, on 1st condition --- B=cuberoot(A*B) thus cubing on both sides we get B^3=A*B and hence A=B^2.<br>2nd condition is about placing digits in particular order to get younger boy mother and father age.<br>if we place there ages in "BA" order,the number we get is 10B+A which is Fathers age. and in order "AB/2",the number is (10A+B)/2 which is Mothers age.<br>10B+A=F & 10A+B=2M and it has been given that F=M+3. and hence 10B+A=M+3. and by first condition A=B^2.<br>On proper substitution we get 10B^2 +B = 2(10B + B^2 - 3) which is 8B^2 - 19B+6=0. we get 2 roots but valid root will be 2. and hence B's age is 2.
