But,now we will tackle the problem in a different way.<br>Let, all the 3 links of GH chain are broken.<br>Then,<br>with the help of 1st broken link, B and C ends are joined.<br>with the help of 2nd broken link, D and E ends are joined.<br>and,<br>With the help of the remaining broken link, F and A ends are joined.<br>So, the above mentioned method explains us that breaking only 3 links and subsequently joining two free ends with each link facilitates us to make a whole closed circular shaped bracelet.<br>Therefore,the cost in this case : 3*(1+.50) = 3*(1.50)=4.50 rupees.<br>So,evidently,the least cost to make the whole bracelet :4.50 rupees.</font><br><br>2) The average of 10 members is 15665.
