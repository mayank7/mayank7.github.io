If the size of the bacteria doubles each day, how long did it take for the bacteria to fill one half of dish?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>When bacterias double their size from half dish to full dish in one day and fill dish in 30 days, it clearly means that on 29 th day, the dish was half full of bacteria.</font><br><br>42) There are two sections in a question paper each contain five questions. A student has to answer 6 questions. Maximum no. of questions that can be answered from any section is 4. How many ways he can attempt the paper ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>5C4*5C2=50<br>5C3*5C3=100<br>5C2*5C4=50<br>50+100+50=200</font><br><br>43) Some boys are standing in a row, Sunil is 10th from right and Anant is seventh from left. If there are five boys in between Sunil and Ananth, how many boys are there in the row?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>22</font><br><br>44) A and B throw a dice. The probabilty that A's throw is not greater than B's is ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>If b's outcome is 6, a's outcome can be 6,5,4,3,2,1.total=6<br>similarly if b's outcome is 5,a's outcome can be 5,4,3,2,1=5<br>so a's outcome which is lower then b is 6+5+4+3+2+1=21<br>and total outcome is 36 so our probability is 21/36 or 7/12.</font><br><br>45) Out of 10 white, 9 black and 7 red balls, in how many ways can we select one or more balls ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>out of p alike things,q alikes things and r alike things, no of ways of selecting one or more = (p+1)*(q+1)*(r+1)-1.<br>so, (11*10*8)-1 =879</font><br><br>46) JAK KBL LCM MDN ______?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>J,K,L,M, (N)<br>A,B,C,D, (E)<br>K,L,M,N, (O)<br>So, answer is NEO.</font><br><br>47) A car is 250 meters behind the bus. The car and bus are moving with speed 60 km/hr and 35 km/hr respectively. The car will be ahead of bus by 250 meters in ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Relative speed=60-35=25 Km/hr<br>For car to be ahead of bus by 250 meter,distance to be covered=250+250=500m=0.5km<br>So time taken=0.5/25=1/50 Hr or 3600/50=72 seconds</font><br><br>48) Two trains each 100m long moving in opposite direction cross each other in 8 seconds if one is moving twice as fast as other then the speed of faster train is?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Let the speed of slow train=x and fast train=2x<br>Distance covered=100+100=200 meters, with the speed=x+2x=3x<br>Time=200/3x=8 sec ->x=25/3 m/s<br>Therefore fast train speed=2x=50/3 m/s=50*3600/3*1000=60 km/hr</font><br><br>49) The difference between two numbers is one-seventh of the sum of these numbers two numbers.
