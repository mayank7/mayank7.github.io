What's the fewest number of times you'd have to use the scale to find the heavier ball?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>2 times,<br>first keep two balls aside,<br>measure 3 and 3 balls.<br>condition1: if it is balanced then the heavy ball is in the two which were kept aside<br>condition2: if any one part is heavey, then the heavy ball is among these 3.<br>if condition 1 is met,scale the two balls which were kept aside, we'll get heavy ball.<br>if second condition is met, then take the 3 balls, and keep one ball aside and scale the other two.</font><br><br>2) If you have two buckets, one with red paint and other with blue paint, and you take one cup from the blue bucket and pour it into the red bucket. Then you take one cup from the red bucket and pour it into the blue bucket. Which bucket has the higher ratio between red and blue?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>let volume of paint in bucket=10 liter<br>volume of cup = 1 liter<br>bucket A= red paint<br>Bucket B= Blue paint<br>after step 1=> Bucket A= 11 liter = 10 liter red + 1 liter blue<br>Bucket B= 9 liter blue<br>now 1 liter of bucket A= 1/11 liter blue and 10/11 red<br>after step 2=> Bucket A= 10 liter=100/11 red +10/11 blue<br>red/blue= 10/1<br>Bucket B= 10 liter<br>= 9 liter blue+1/11 blue +10/11 red<br>= 100/11 blue + 10/11 red .<br>red/blue = 1/10<br>so ratio of red/blue is (10/1) higher in first bucket of red paint than the ratio of red/blue (1/10) in second bucket.</font><br><br>3) There are 4 women who want to cross a bridge. They all begin on the same side. You have 17 minutes to get all of them across to the other side. It is night.<br>There is one flashlight. A maximum of two people can cross at one time. Any party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the flashlight with them. The flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot be thrown, etc.<br>Each woman walks at a different speed. A pair must walk together at the rate of the slower woman's pace.<br>Woman 1: 1 minute to cross<br>Woman 2: 2 minutes to cross<br>Woman 3: 5 minutes to cross<br>Woman 4: 10 minutes to cross<br>For example if Woman 1 and Woman 4 walk across first, 10 minutes have elapsed when they get to the other side of the bridge. If Woman 4 then returns with the flashlight, a total of 20 minutes have passed and you have failed the mission.<br>What is the order required to get all women across in 17 minutes? Now, what's the other way?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Woman 1 and 2 cross and take 2 mins ........................ 2 mins<br>woman 1 comes back............................................1 min<br>woman 3 and w cross bridge in 10 mis .........................10 mins<br>woman 2 comes back ...........................................2 mins.<br>Woman 1 and 2 cross and take 2 mins ........................ 2 mins<br>Total time taken = 2+1+10+2+2= 17 mins</font><br><br>4) If you had an infinite supply of water and a 5 quart and 3 quart pail, how would you measure exactly 4 quarts?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>status of pails 5q 3q<br>1st 0 0<br>2nd 5 0<br>3rd 2 3<br>4th 2 0<br>5th 0 2<br>6th 5 2<br>7th 4 3<br>4 is in 5q pail</font><br><br>5) You have a bucket of jelly beans. Some are red, some are blue, and some green. With your eyes closed, pick out 2 of a like color. How many do you have to grab to be sure you have 2 of the same?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Minimum 4 because in three picks they may be of different colour like red ,blue and green but 4th pick will match with at least one of its own colour</font><br><br>6) You've got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay them. The gold bar is segmented into seven connected pieces. You must give them a piece of gold at the end of every day. If you are only allowed to make two breaks in the gold bar, how do you pay your worker?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Cut the gold bar into 1,2,4 pieces ...<br>1st day - give 1<br>2nd day - get 1 and give 2<br>3rd day - give 1<br>4th day - give 4 and get 1,2<br>5th day - give 1<br>6th day - give 2 and get 1<br>7th day - give 1</font><br><br>7) You have two jars, 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles. A jar will be picked at random, and then a marble will be picked from the jar. Placing all of the marbles in the jars, how can you maximize the chances of a red marble being picked? What are the exact odds of getting a red marble using your scheme?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>One red ball in one jar. 49 red + 50 blue in second jar. probability to get red ball is 1/2(1+49/99) = 74/99.</font><br><br>8) The SF Chronicle has a word game where all the letters are scrambled up and you have to figure out what the word is. Imagine that a scrambled word is 5 characters long: How many possible solutions are there? What if we know which 5 letters are being used?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Total 26 letters so 26 letters can be arranged in 26^5 and if we know 5 letters than 5! ways.</font><br><br>9) There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs. Outside the room there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but once you open the door you can't change them. Identify each switch with its bulb?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Turn on a switch and leave it for some ten minutes. Turn it off, turn a second one on and open the door and go into the room. The glowing bulb corresponds to second switch. The bulb that is hot corresponds to first switch, as it was turned on for ten minutes and have heated up. The cold and not-glowing bulb corresponds to the third switch.</font><br><br>10) One train leaves Los Angeles at 15mph heading for New York. Another train leaves from New York at 20mph heading for Los Angeles on the same track. If a bird, flying at 25mph, leaves from Los Angeles at the same time as the train and flies back and forth between the two trains until they collide, how far will the bird have traveled?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>This is an infinite round problem means the bird will complete infinite rounds in this manner now for finding the total distance traveled by the bird let us consider the total distance between the two given stations as L. Here since the distance between these two stations is not given so answer will be in terms of L. speed of the two trains moving in opposite directions are 15 mph and 20 mph. so time taken for the collision between the trains will be L/(15+20) = L/35 In this much time the bird will move 25*L/35 miles = 5L/7 miles.</font><br><br><center><a href="2.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
