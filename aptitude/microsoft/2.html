You have a balance to measure balls against each other. In 2 weighings how do you find the defective one?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Group it as 3, 3 and 2. Weigh 3 against 3. If same, wigh one each from the remaining two to find the defective.<br>Otherwise, take the lighter group, as it contains the defective ball. Weigh one from it against any other one.<br>If same weight, remaining is defective. Otherwise the lighter one is defective.</font><br><br>12) There are 3 baskets. one of them have apples, one has oranges only and the other has mixture of apples and oranges. The labels on their baskets always lie. (i.e. if the label says oranges, you are sure that it doesn't have oranges only,it could be a mixture)<br>The task is to pick one basket and pick only one fruit from it and then correctly label all the three baskets.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Pick any basket. Pick a fruit from it. It will either be an orange or an apple. If you get a fruit from a basket labelled by its name, this basket is sure to contain the MIXTURE.<br>Relabel it as mixture. Now there are two baskets remaining. One with label MIXTURE and other with that of a fruit(say, ORAANGE). Since the second label is wrong and also since it doesnot contain the mixture, relabel it as one containing other fruit(APPLE).<br>The remaining can be easily labelled, if you got two right.</font><br><br>13) There are three taps A,B and C.they can fill the tank in 10,20,and 25 hrs respectively.At first all of them are opened simultaneously.Then after 2 hrs tap C is closed and A and B are kept running.After the 4rth hour tap B is closed.<br>The remaining work is done by tap A alone.Find the percentage of the work done by Tap A by itself?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>work done by a,b and c in 2 hours=19/50<br>work done by a and b in another 2 hr=3/10<br>19/50+3/10+x=1<br>x=16/50*100%<br>=32%.</font><br><br>14) Divide 110 into 2 parts so that one will be 150 percent of the other.what are the 2 no.s ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>If 1st part or number=x ,then another will be x*150/100=1.5x<br>Given x+1.5x=110, x=44<br>So another number=1.5*44=66.</font><br><br>15) x+y=m<br>x*y=m<br>and x is not equal to y then find x and y?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>The problem cannot have a single solution rather it will have an infinite solution set,<br>the solution set can be defined as :<br>for n>0,<br>x=1/(n+1)<br>y=1/(-n)<br>Ex: -1/2 and 1/3.</font><br><br>16) Ashok, Eesha, Farook and Gowri ran a race.
