Then what is the 5th day after 21st of that month?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>3rd day is monday<br>10th day is also monday<br>17th day is also monday<br>24 day is monday<br>25 is tuesday<br>26 isa wednesday.</font><br><br>52) What is the missing number of the this sequence 9, --, 15, 18, 21, 24?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Its in AP, so answer is 12.</font><br><br>53) 5 mangoes + 4 oranges = 7 mangoes + 1 orange. Find the ratio of mango to orange ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>5m + 4o = 7m + o<br>=> 3o = 2m<br>=> m/o = 3/2<br>Therefore ratio of Mangoes to Oranges is 3:2.</font><br><br>54) A cistern can be filled by two pipes A and B in 7 1/2 h. Both of them are open for 2 1/2 h and then B is closed. A alone now require 6 2/3 h more to fill cistern. How long would A take to fill the cistern working alone?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>a+b=2/15<br>(a+b)*5/2 + a*(20/3) =1<br>55a+15b=6,<br>15a+15b=2<br>So, a can do it in 10 hours.</font><br><br>55) A cistern has three pipes A,B and C the pipes A and B can fill it in 4 and 5 hours respectively and C can empty it hours. If the pipes are opened in order at 1, 2 and 3 a.m. Respectively, when will the cistern be empty?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>tank filled up to 3 am = 2*1/4 + 1/5 = 1/2 +1/5 = 7/10<br>tank drained in 1 hr when 3 pipes are opened = 1/2 -1/4 -1/5 = 1/20<br>so already filled 7/10 tank is drained in 14 hrs i.e. at 3+14 = 1700 hrs or 5PM.</font><br><br>56) Three pipes A,B and C can fill a cistern in 7 hours.After working at it together for 2 hours C is closed. Now A and B require 10 hours more to fill it. How long will C take to fill the cistern alone?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>(a+b+c)=1/7 hrs<br>(a+b)*10=5/7<br>(a+b+c)*2=2/7<br>After solving c =1/14,<br>So, c will take 14 hours.</font><br><br>57) A cistern is filled in 9 hours and it takes 10 hours when there is a leak in its bottom. If the cistern is full, in what time will the leak empty it ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Work done by leak in 1hr=1/9-1/10=1/90<br>So, answer is 90 hours.</font><br><br>58) A cistern is normally filled by a tap in 5 hours, but suddenly a leak develops and it empties the full cistern in 30 hours. With the leak, the cistern is filled in how many hours ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Work done by the tap and the leak in 1 hr=(1/5-1/30)=5/30=1/6<br>since 1/6 part is fill 1n 1hr<br>so 1 part is fill in 6hrs.</font><br><br><center><a href="5.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a></center></font></b></body></html>
