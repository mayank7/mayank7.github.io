Another person started from college towards home after an hour. the speed of first one is 4kmph and the second one is 3 kmph. Then, what is the distance from home to their meeting point?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Ans is 32 kms from home and 21 kms from college.<br>If s is distance from home where they met , then<br>s/4 = 1+ (53-s)/3<br>solving it, we get s= 32 kms.<br>The first person travelled 32 kms in 8 hrs @ 4kmph and The 2nd person travelled 21 kms in 7 hrs @ 3kmph.</font><br><br>4) 3 machines can complete the work in 4,5, and 6 hours respectively. due to power failures they did the work alternatively. Then what is time taken to complete the work?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>3 machines can complete the work in 4,5, and 6 hours respectively. due to power failures they did the work alternatively.<br>Work done in 1st hr = 15/60<br>Work done in 2nd hr = 12/60<br>Work done in 3rd hr = 10/60<br>Work done in 4th hr = 15/60<br>Balance work = 1-(15+12+10+15)/60 =1-52/60 = 8/60<br>Time taken for 8/60 work by 2nd machine = (8/60)*(60/12)=8/12 hrs = 2/3 hrs =40 mins<br>so total time taken = 4 hrs 40 mins.</font><br><br>5) Pipe A takes 16 min to fill a tank. Pipes B and C, whose cross-sectional circumferences are in the ratio 2:3, fill another tank twice as big as the first. If A has a cross-sectional circumference that is one-third of C, how long will it take for B and C to fill the second tank?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Let the cross sectional circumference of A is x so its area will be proportional to x^2, now it is given that A has a cross-sectional circumference that is one-third of C,<br>so cross sectional circumference of C will be 3x, and its area will be proportional to 9x^2,<br>according to the given condition, cross sectional circumference of B will be (2/3)*3x = 2x, so its area will be proportional to 4x^2<br>since pipe A for which cross sectional area is proportional to x^2, fills the tank in 16 min.<br>So pipe B and C for which sum of cross sectional area is proportional to 13x^2, will fill the same tank in 16/13 min.<br>But second tank is twice big in size so time required = 2*16/13 = 32/13 min.</font><br><br>6) The arithmetic mean of 2 numbers is 34 and their geometric mean is 16.
