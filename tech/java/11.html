Can an abstract class be final?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>An abstract class may not be declared as final.</font><br><br>102. What is numeric promotion?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Numeric promotion is the conversion of a smaller numeric type to a larger numeric type, so that integer and floatingpoint operations may take place. In numerical promotion, byte, char, and short values are converted to int values. The int values are also converted to long values, if necessary. The long and float values are converted to double values, as required.</font><br><br>103. What is the difference between a public and a non-public class?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A public class may be accessed outside of its package. A non-public class may not be accessed outside of its package.</font><br><br>104. To what value is a variable of the boolean type automatically initialized?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The default value of the boolean type is false.</font><br><br>105. What is the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the ++ operator?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The prefix form performs the increment operation and returns the value of the increment operation. The postfix form returns the current value all of the expression and then performs the increment operation on that value.</font><br><br>106. What restrictions are placed on method overriding?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Overridden methods must have the same name, argument list, and return type. The overriding method may not limit the access of the method it overrides. The overriding method may not throw any exceptions that may not be thrown by the overridden method.</font><br><br>107. What is a Java package and how is it used?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A Java package is a naming context for classes and interfaces. A package is used to create a separate name space for groups of classes and interfaces. Packages are also used to organize related classes and interfaces into a single API unit and to control accessibility to these classes and interfaces.</font><br><br>108. What modifiers may be used with a top-level class?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A top-level class may be public, abstract, or final.</font><br><br>109. What is the difference between an if statement and a switch statement?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The if statement is used to select among two alternatives. It uses a boolean expression to decide which alternative should be executed. The switch statement is used to select among multiple alternatives. It uses an int expression to determine which alternative should be executed.</font><br><br>110. What are the practical benefits, if any, of importing a specific class rather than an entire package (e.g. import java.net.* versus import java.net.Socket)?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It makes no difference in the generated class files since only the classes that are actually used are referenced by the generated class file. There is another practical benefit to importing single classes, and this arises when two (or more) packages have classes with the same name. Take java.util.Timer and javax.swing.Timer, for example. If I import java.util.* and javax.swing.* and then try to use "Timer", I get an error while compiling (the class name is ambiguous between both packages). Let's say what you really wanted was the javax.swing.Timer class, and the only classes you plan on using in java.util are Collection and HashMap. In this case, some people will prefer to import java.util.Collection and import java.util.HashMap instead of importing java.util.*. This will now allow them to use Timer, Collection, HashMap, and other javax.swing classes without using fully qualified class names in.</font><br><br><center><a href="10.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="12.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
