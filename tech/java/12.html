Can a method be overloaded based on different return type but same argument type ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>No, because the methods can be called without using their return type in which case there is ambiquity for the compiler.</font><br><br>112. What happens to a static variable that is defined within a method of a class ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Can't do it. You'll get a compilation error.</font><br><br>113. How many static initializers can you have ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>As many as you want, but the static initializers and class variable initializers are executed in textual order and may not refer to class variables declared in the class whose declarations appear textually after the use, even though these class variables are in scope.</font><br><br>114. What is the difference between method overriding and overloading?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Overriding is a method with the same name and arguments as in a parent, whereas overloading is the same method name but different arguments</font><br><br>115. What is constructor chaining and how is it achieved in Java ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A child object constructor always first needs to construct its parent (which in turn calls its parent constructor.). In Java it is done via an implicit call to the no-args constructor as the first statement.</font><br><br>116. What is the difference between the Boolean & operator and the && operator?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>If an expression involving the Boolean & operator is evaluated, both operands are evaluated. Then the & operator is applied to the operand. When an expression involving the && operator is evaluated, the first operand is evaluated. If the first operand returns a value of true then the second operand is evaluated. The && operator is then applied to the first and second operands. If the first operand evaluates to false, the evaluation of the second operand is skipped.</font><br><br>117. Which Java operator is right associative?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The = operator is right associative.</font><br><br>118. Can a double value be cast to a byte?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Yes, a double value can be cast to a byte.</font><br><br>119. What is the difference between a break statement and a continue statement?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A break statement results in the termination of the statement to which it applies (switch, for, do, or while). A continue statement is used to end the current loop iteration and return control to the loop statement.</font><br><br>120. Can a for statement loop indefinitely?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Yes, a for statement can loop indefinitely. For example, consider the following: for(;;);</font><br><br><center><a href="11.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="13.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
