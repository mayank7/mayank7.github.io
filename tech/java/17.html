Primitive data types are passed by reference or pass by value?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Primitive data types are passed by value.</font><br><br>162. Objects are passed by value or by reference?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Java only supports pass by value. With objects, the object reference itself is passed by value and so both the original reference and parameter copy both refer to the same object.</font><br><br>163. What is serialization?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Serialization is a mechanism by which you can save the state of an object by converting it to a byte stream.</font><br><br>164. How do I serialize an object to a file?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The class whose instances are to be serialized should implement an interface Serializable. Then you pass the instance to the ObjectOutputStream which is connected to a fileoutputstream. This will save the object to a file.</font><br><br>165. Which methods of Serializable interface should I implement?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The serializable interface is an empty interface, it does not contain any methods. So we do not implement any methods.</font><br><br>166. How can I customize the seralization process? i.e. how can one have a control over the serialization process?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Yes it is possible to have control over serialization process. The class should implement Externalizable interface. This interface contains two methods namely readExternal and writeExternal. You should implement these methods and write the logic for customizing the serialization process.</font><br><br>167. What is the common usage of serialization?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Whenever an object is to be sent over the network, objects need to be serialized. Moreover if the state of an object is to be saved, objects need to be serilazed.</font><br><br>168. What is Externalizable interface?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Externalizable is an interface which contains two methods readExternal and writeExternal. These methods give you a control over the serialization mechanism. Thus if your class implements this interface, you can customize the serialization process by implementing these methods.</font><br><br>169. When you serialize an object, what happens to the object references included in the object?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The serialization mechanism generates an object graph for serialization. Thus it determines whether the included object references are serializable or not. This is a recursive process. Thus when an object is serialized, all the included objects are also serialized alongwith the original obect.</font><br><br>170. What one should take care of while serializing the object?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>One should make sure that all the included objects are also serializable. If any of the objects is not serializable then it throws a NotSerializableException.</font><br><br><center><a href="16.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="18.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
