What is the most important feature of Java?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Java is a platform independent language.</font><br><br>2. What do you mean by platform independence?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Platform independence means that we can write and compile the java code in one platform (eg Windows) and can execute the class in any other supported platform eg (Linux,Solaris,etc).</font><br><br>3. What is a JVM?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>JVM is Java Virtual Machine which is a run time environment for the compiled java class files.</font><br><br>4. Are JVM's platform independent?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>JVM's are not platform independent. JVM's are platform specific run time implementation provided by the vendor.</font><br><br>5. What is the difference between a JDK and a JVM?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>JDK is Java Development Kit which is for development purpose and it includes execution environment also. But JVM is purely a run time environment and hence you will not be able to compile your source files using a JVM.</font><br><br>6. What is a pointer and does Java support pointers?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Pointer is a reference handle to a memory location. Improper handling of pointers leads to memory leaks and reliability issues hence Java doesn't support the usage of pointers.</font><br><br>7. What is the base class of all classes?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>java.lang.Object</font><br><br>8. Does Java support multiple inheritance?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Java doesn't support multiple inheritance.</font><br><br>9. Is Java a pure object oriented language?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Java uses primitive data types and hence is not a pure object oriented language.</font><br><br>10. Are arrays primitive data types?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>In Java, Arrays are objects.</font><br><br><center><a href="2.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
