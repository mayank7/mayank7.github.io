What is the range of the char type?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The range of the char type is 0 to 216 - 1 (i.e. 0 to 65535.)</font><br><br>82. What is the range of the short type?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The range of the short type is -(215) to 215 - 1. (i.e. -32,768 to 32,767)</font><br><br>83. Why isn't there operator overloading?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Because C++ has proven by example that operator overloading makes code almost impossible to maintain.</font><br><br>84. What does it mean that a method or field is "static"?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Static variables and methods are instantiated only once per class. In other words they are class variables, not instance variables. If you change the value of a static variable in a particular object, the value of that variable changes for all instances of that class. Static methods can be referenced with the name of the class rather than the name of a particular object of the class (though that works too). That's how library methods like System.out.println() work. out is a static field in the java.lang.System class.</font><br><br>85. Is null a keyword?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The null value is not a keyword.</font><br><br>86.

Is the ternary operator written x : y ? z or x ? y : z ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is written x ? y : z.</font><br><br>88. How is rounding performed under integer division?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The fractional part of the result is truncated. This is known as rounding toward zero.</font><br><br>89. If a class is declared without any access modifiers, where may the class be accessed?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A class that is declared without any access modifiers is said to have package access. This means that the class can only be accessed by other classes and interfaces that are defined within the same package.</font><br><br>90. Does a class inherit the constructors of its superclass?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A class does not inherit constructors from any of its superclasses.</font><br><br><center><a href="8.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="10.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
