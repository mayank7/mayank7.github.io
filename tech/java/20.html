When a thread is created and started, what is its initial state?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A thread is in the ready state after it has been created and started.</font><br><br>192. What is the purpose of finalization?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The purpose of finalization is to give an unreachable object the opportunity to perform any cleanup processing before the object is garbage collected.</font><br><br>193. What is the Locale class?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The Locale class is used to tailor program output to the conventions of a particular geographic, political, or cultural region.</font><br><br>194. What is the difference between a while statement and a do statement?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A while statement checks at the beginning of a loop to see whether the next loop iteration should occur. A do statement checks at the end of a loop to see whether the next iteration of a loop should occur. The do statement will always execute the body of a loop at least once.</font><br><br>195. What is the difference between static and non-static variables?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A static variable is associated with the class as a whole rather than with specific instances of a class. Non-static variables take on unique values with each object instance.</font><br><br>196. How are this() and super() used with constructors?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>this() is used to invoke a constructor of the same class. super() is used to invoke a superclass constructor.</font><br><br>197. What is daemon thread and which method is used to create the daemon thread?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Daemon thread is a low priority thread which runs intermittently in the back ground doing the garbage collection operation for the java runtime system.setDaemon method is used to create a daemon thread.</font><br><br>198. Can applets communicate with each other?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>At this point in time applets may communicate with other applets running in the same virtual machine. If the applets are of the same class, they can communicate via shared static variables. If the applets are of different classes, then each will need a reference to the same class with static variables. In any case the basic idea is to pass the information back and forth through a static variable. An applet can also get references to all other applets on the same page using the getApplets() method of java.applet.AppletContext. Once you get the reference to an applet, you can communicate with it by using its public members. It is conceivable to have applets in different virtual machines that talk to a server somewhere on the Internet and store any data that needs to be serialized there. Then, when another applet needs this data, it could connect to this same server. Implementing this is non-trivial.</font><br><br>199. What are the steps in the JDBC connection?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>While making a JDBC connection we go through the following steps : Step 1 : Register the database driver by using : Class.forName(\" driver classs for that specific database\" ); Step 2 : Now create a database connection using : Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,username,password); Step 3: Now Create a query using : Statement stmt = Connection.Statement(\"select * from TABLE NAME\"); Step 4 : Exceute the query : stmt.exceuteUpdate();</font><br><br>200. How does a try statement determine which catch clause should be used to handle an exception?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>When an exception is thrown within the body of a try statement, the catch clauses of the try statement are examined in the order in which they appear. The first catch clause that is capable of handling the exceptionis executed. The remaining catch clauses are ignored.</font><br><br><center><a href="19.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="21.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
