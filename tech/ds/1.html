What is data structure?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>- Data structure is a group of data elements grouped together under one name. <br>These data elements are called members. They can have different types and different lengths.<br>- Some of them store the data of same type while others store different types of data.
Some of the data structure are:<br><u>Lists:</u> A group of similar items with connectivity to the previous or/and next data items.<br><u>Arrays:</u> A set of homogeneous values<br><u>Records:</u> A set of fields, where each field consists of data belongs to one data type.<br><u>Trees:</u> A data structure where the data is organized in a hierarchical structure. This type of data structure follows the sorted order of insertion, deletion and modification of data items.<br><u>Tables:</u> Data is persisted in the form of rows and columns. These are similar to records, where the result or manipulation of data is reflected for the whole table.</font><br><br>2. Which data structure is used to perform recursion?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>- The data structure used for recursion is Stack.<br>- Its LIFO property helps it remembers its 'caller'. This helps it know the data which is to be returned when the function has to return.<br>- System stack is used for storing the return addresses of the function calls.<br><br>
<u>Base case:</u> A case in recursion, in which the answer is known when the termination for a recursive condition is to unwind back.<br><u>Recursive Case:</u> A case which returns to the answer which is closer.<br><u>Run-time Stack:</u> A run time stack used for saving the frame stack of a function when every recursion or every call occurs.<br><u>Tail Recursion:</u> It is a situation where a single recursive call is consisted by a function, and it is the final statement to be executed. It can be replaced by iteration.</font><br><br>3. Does the Minimal Spanning tree of a graph give the shortest distance between any 2 specified nodes?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br> No, it doesn’t.<br>It assures that the total weight of the tree is kept to minimum.<br>- It doesn't imply that the distance between any two nodes involved in the minimum-spanning tree is minimum.</font><br><br>4. If you are using C language to implement the heterogeneous linked list, what pointer type will you use?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A heterogeneous linked list contains different data types in its nodes. We can not use ordinary pointer to connect them.<br>- The pointer that we use in such a case is void pointer as it is a generic pointer type and capable of storing pointer to any type.</font><br><br>5. Explain the applications of Stack, Queue, Tree and Graph?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br><u>Application of Stack:</u><br> It is used in various expression conversion and evaluation - infix to post-fix or prefix evaluation.<br>Stack is implicitly used by system while calling to sub routines function from main program.<br>Recursion<br><br><u>Application of Queue:</u><br>Used by operating system in scheduling jobs and spooling (queue of print jobs)<br>Disk I/O calls<br>Queue is also part of the architecture of processors ex- 80386,8086<br>Queues are used for any situation where you want to efficiently maintain a First-in-first out order on some entities<br><br><u>Application of Tree:</u><br> On a computer - The file scheme uses tree architecture; a list of options system also has the same idea of selecting radical strata of options. <br>Indexes in a book have a narrow tree structure - letter/subjects starting with that letter. Contents probably have a superior layout - the different levels of chapters.<br>In computer science, a tree is a commonly used data formation that feigns a hierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes.<br><br><u>Application of Graph:</u><br> In computer science, graphs are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc.<br>The link structure of a website could be represented by a directed graph. The vertices are the web pages available at the website and a directed edge from page A to page B exists if and only if A contains a link to B. <br>Finding shortest distance between two nodes etc.</font><br><br>6. When is a binary search algorithm best applied?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br> It is best applied to search a list when the elements are already in order or sorted.<br>- The list here is searched starting in the middle. If that middle value is not the correct one, the lower or the upper half is searched in the similar way</font><br><br>7. How do you reference all the elements in a one-dimension array?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>This is done using an indexed loop.<br>- The counter runs from 0 to the array size minus one. <br>
- Using the loop counter as the array subscript helps in referencing all the elements in one-dimensional array.</font><br><br>8. What is Huffman’s algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is used in creating extended binary trees that have minimum weighted path lengths from the given weights.<br>- It makes use of a table that contains frequency of occurrence for each data element.</font><br><br>9. Differentaite between Tree and Graph?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>&bull; Tree is special form of graph i.e. minimally connected graph and having only one path between any two vertices whereas in Graph there can be more than one path i.e. graph can have uni-directional or bi-directional paths (edges) between nodes<br><br>&bull;Tree is a special case of graph having no loops, no circuits and no self-loops but Graph can have loops, circuits as well as can have self-loops.<br><br>&bull;In Tree, there is exactly one root node and every child have only one parent whereas in Graph there is no such concept of root node.<br><br>&bull;In Trees, there is parent child relationship so flow can be there with direction top to bottom or vice versa but in Graph there is no such parent child relationship.<br><br>&bull;Trees are less complex then graphs as having no cycles, no self-loops and still connected but	Graphs are more complex in compare to trees as it can have cycles, loops etc<br><br>&bull;Tree traversal is a kind of special case of traversal of graph. Tree is traversed in Pre-Order, In-Order and Post-Order (all three in DFS or in BFS algorithm)	whereas Graph is traversed by DFS and BFS algorithm<br><br>&bull;In Trees, there are many rules / restrictions for making connections between nodes through edges.	In Graphs, no such rules/ restrictions are there for connecting the nodes through edges.<br><br>&bull;Trees come in the category of DAG : Directed Acyclic Graphs is a kind of directed graph that have no cycles whereas Graph can be Cyclic or Acyclic.<br><br>&bull;Different types of trees are : Binary Tree , Binary Search Tree, AVL tree, Heaps.	But there are mainly two types of Graphs : Directed and Undirected graphs.<br><br>&bull;Tree applications : sorting and searching like Tree Traversal & Binary Search whereas Graph applications : Coloring of maps, in OR (PERT & CPM), algorithms, Graph coloring, job scheduling, etc.<br><br>&bull;Tree always has n-1 edges but in Graph, no. of edges depend on the graph.<br><br>&bull;Tree is a hierarchical model and Graph is a network model.</font><br><br>10. How does dynamic memory allocation help in managing data?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Dynamic memory allocation helps to store simple structured data types.<br>- It can combine separately allocated structured blocks to form composite structures that expand and contract as required.</font><br><br><center><a href="2.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
