Explain its uses with an example<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A matrix is a representation of certain rows and columns, to persist homogeneous data. It can also be called as doubledimensioned array. Uses: To represent class hierarchy using Boolean square matrix For data encryption and decryption To represent traffic flow and plumbing in a network To implement graph theory of node representation</font><br><br>72. Define an algorithm. What are the properties of an algorithm? What are the types of algorithms?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Algorithm: A step by step process to get the solution for a well defined problem. Properties of an algorithm: Should be written in simple English Should be unambiguous, precise and lucid Should provide the correct solutions Should have an end point The output statements should follow input, process instructions The initial statements should be of input statements Should have finite number of steps Every statement should be definitive<br><br>Types of algorithms:<br>Simple recursive algorithms. Ex: Searching an element in a list � Backtracking algorithms Ex: Depthfirst recursive search in a tree � Divide and conquer algorithms. Ex: Quick sort and merge sort � Dynamic programming algorithms. Ex: Generation of Fibonacci series � Greedy algorithms Ex: Counting currency � Branch and bound algorithms. Ex: Travelling salesman (visiting each city once and minimize the total distance travelled) � Brute force algorithms. Ex: Finding the best path for a travelling salesman � Randomized algorithms. Ex. Using a random number to choose a pivot in quick sort).</font><br><br>73. What is an iterative algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The process of attempting for solving a problem which finds successive approximations for solution, starting from an initial guess. The result of repeated calculations is a sequence of approximate values for the quantities of interest.</font><br><br>74. What is an recursive algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Recursive algorithm is a method of simplification that divides the problem into subproblems of the same nature. The result of one recursion is the input for the next recursion. The repletion is in the self similar fashion. The algorithm calls itself with smaller input values and obtains the results by simply performing the operations on these smaller values. Generation of factorial, Fibonacci number series are the examples of recursive algorithms.</font><br><br>75. Explain quick sort and merge sort algorithms.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Select an element, pivot, from the list. 2. Rearrange the elements in the list, so that all elements those are less than the pivot are arranged before the pivot and all elements those are greater than the pivot are arranged after the pivot. Now the pivot is in its position. 3. Sort the both sub lists � sub list of the elements which are less than the pivot and the list of elements which are more than the pivot recursively. Merge Sort: A comparison based sorting algorithm. The input order is preserved in the sorted output. Merge Sort algorithm is as follows: 1. The length of the list is 0 or 1, and then it is considered as sorted. 2. Other wise, divide the unsorted list into 2 lists each about half the size. 3. Sort each sub list recursively. Implement the step 2 until the two sub lists are sorted. 4. As a final step, combine (merge) both the lists back into one sorted list.</font><br><br>76. What is Bubble Sort and Quick sort?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Bubble Sort: The simplest sorting algorithm. It involves the sorting the list in a repetitive fashion. It compares two adjacent elements in the list, and swaps them if they are not in the designated order. It continues until there are no swaps needed. This is the signal for the list that is sorted. It is also called as comparison sort as it uses comparisons. Quick Sort: The best sorting algorithm which implements the �divide and conquer� concept. It first divides the list into two parts by picking an element a �pivot�. It then arranges the elements those are smaller than pivot into one sub list and the elements those are greater than pivot into one sub list by keeping the pivot in its original place.</font><br><br>77. What are the difference between a stack and a Queue?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Stack � Represents the collection of elements in Last In First Out order. Operations includes testing null stack, finding the top element in the stack, removal of top most element and adding elements on the top of the stack. Queue Represents the collection of elements in First In First Out order. Operations include testing null queue, finding the next element, removal of elements and inserting the elements from the queue. Insertion of elements is at the end of the queue Deletion of elements is from the beginning of the queue.</font><br><br>78. Can a stack be described as a pointer? Explain.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A stack is represented as a pointer. The reason is that, it has a head pointer which points to the top of the stack. The stack operations are performed using the head pointer. Hence, the stack can be described as a pointer.</font><br><br>79. Explain the terms Base case, Recursive case, Binding Time, RunTime Stack and Tail Recursion.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Base case: A case in recursion, in which the answer is known when the termination for a recursive condition is to unwind back. Recursive Case: A case which returns to the answer which is closer. Runtime Stack: A run time stack used for saving the frame stack of a function when every recursion or every call occurs. Tail Recursion: It is a situation where a single recursive call is consisted by a function, and it is the final statement to be executed. It can be replaced by iteration.</font><br><br>80. Is it possible to insert different type of elements in a stack? How?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Different elements can be inserted into a stack. This is possible by implementing union / structure data type. It is efficient to use union rather than structure, as only one item�s memory is used at a time.</font><br><br><center><a href="7.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="9.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
