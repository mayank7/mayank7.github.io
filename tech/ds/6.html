What is a postfix expression?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is an expression in which each operator follows its operands. Here, there is no need to group subexpressions in parentheses or to consider operator precedence..</font><br><br>52. What are the types of data structures?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The scheme of organizing related information is known as �data structure�. The types of data structure are: Lists: A group of similar items with connectivity to the previous or/and next data items</font><br><br>53. Define a linear and non linear data structure.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Linear data structure: A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached. Ex: Arrays, Linked Lists.</font><br><br>54. Define in brief an array. What are the types of array operations?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>An array is a set of homogeneous elements. Every element is referred by an index. Arrays are used for storing the data until the application expires in the main memory of the computer system. So that, the elements can be accessed at any time. The operations are: Traversal, Deletion, Insertion.</font><br><br>55. What is a matrix? Explain its uses with an example<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A matrix is a representation of certain rows and columns, to persist homogeneous data. It can also be called as doubledimensioned array</font><br><br>56.Define an algorithm. What are the properties of an algorithm? What are the types of algorithms?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Algorithm: A step by step process to get the solution for a well defined problem</font><br><br>57. What is an iterative algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The process of attempting for solving a problem which finds successive approximations for solution, starting from an initial guess.</font><br><br>58. What is an recursive algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Recursive algorithm is a method of simplification that divides the problem into subproblems of the same nature. The result of one recursion is the input for the next recursion.</font><br><br>59. What is the Huffman algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>In Huffman Algorithm, a set of nodes assigned with values if fed to the algorithm..</font><br><br>60. Explain quick sort and merge sort algorithms.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Quick sort employs the �divide and conquer� concept by dividing the list of elements into two sub elements</font><br><br><center><a href="5.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="7.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
