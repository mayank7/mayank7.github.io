What is a bubble sort and how do you perform it?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Bubble sort is a sorting technique which can be applied to data structures like arrays. Here, the adjacent values are compared and their positions are exchanged if they are out of order. The smaller value bubbles up to the top of the list, while the larger value sinks to the bottom.</font><br><br>62. How does variable declaration affect memory allocation?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The amount of memory to be allocated depends on the data type of the variable. An integer type variable is needs 32 bits of memory storage to be reserved.</font><br><br>63. You want to insert a new item in a binary search tree. How would you do it?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Let us assume that the you want to insert is unique. First of all, check if the tree is empty. If it is empty, you can insert the new item in the root node. If it is not empty, refer to the new item�s key. If the data to be entered is smaller than the root�s key, insert it into the root�s left subtree. Otherwise, insert it into the root�s right subtree.</font><br><br>64. Why is the isEmpty() member method called?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The isEmpty() member method is called during the dequeue process. It helps in ascertaining if there exists any item in the queue which needs to be removed. This method is called by the dequeue() method before returning the front element.</font><br><br>65. What is a queue ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A Queue refers to a sequential organization of data. It is a FIFO type data structure in which an element is always inserted at the last position and any element is always removed from the first position.</font><br><br>66. What is adequeue?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A dequeue is a doubleended queue. The elements here can be inserted or removed from either end.</font><br><br>67. What is a postfix expression?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is an expression in which each operator follows its operands. Here, there is no need to group subexpressions in parentheses or to consider operator precedence..</font><br><br>68. What are the types of data structures?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The scheme of organizing related information is known as �data structure�. The types of data structure are: Lists: A group of similar items with connectivity to the previous or/and next data items..</font><br><br>69. Define a linear and non linear data structure.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Linear data structure: A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached. Ex: Arrays, Linked Lists</font><br><br>70. Define in brief an array. What are the types of array operations?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>An array is a set of homogeneous elements. Every element is referred by an index. Arrays are used for storing the data until the application expires in the main memory of the computer system. So that, the elements can be accessed at any time. The operations are:Traversal, Deletion, Insertion.</font><br><br><center><a href="6.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="8.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
