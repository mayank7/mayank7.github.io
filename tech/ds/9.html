Explain in brief a linked list.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A linked list is a dynamic data structure. It consists of a sequence of data elements and a reference to the next record in the sequence. Stacks, queues, hash tables, linear equations, prefix and post fix operations. The order of linked items is different that of arrays. The insertion or deletion operations are constant in number.</font><br><br>82. Explain the types of linked lists.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The types of linked lists are: Singly linked list: It has only head part and corresponding references to the next nodes. Doubly linked list: A linked list which both head and tail parts, thus allowing the traversal in bidirectional fashion. Except the first node, the head node refers to the previous node. Circular linked list: A linked list whose last node has reference to the first node.</font><br><br>83. How would you sort a linked list?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Step 1: Compare the current node in the unsorted list with every element in the rest of the list. If the current element is more than any other element go to step 2 otherwise go to step 3. Step 2: Position the element with higher value after the position of the current element. Compare the next element. Go to step1 if an element exists, else stop the process. Step 3: If the list is already in sorted order, insert the current node at the end of the list. Compare the next element, if any and go to step 1 or quit.</font><br><br>84. What is sequential search? What is the average number of comparisons in a sequential search?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Sequential search: Searching an element in an array, the search starts from the first element till the last element. The average number of comparisons in a sequential search is (N+1)/2 where N is the size of the array. If the element is in the 1st position, the number of comparisons will be 1 and if the element is in the last position, the number of comparisons will be N.</font><br><br>85. What are binary search and Fibonacci search?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Binary Search: Binary search is the process of locating an element in a sorted list. The search starts by dividing the list into two parts. The algorithm compares the median value. If the search element is less than the median value, the top list only will be searched, after finding the middle element of that list. The process continues until the element is found or the search in the top list is completed. The same process is continued for the bottom list, until the element is found or the search in the bottom list is completed. If an element is found that must be the median value. Fibonacci Search: Fibonacci search is a process of searching a sorted array by utilizing divide and conquer algorithm. Fibonacci search examines locations whose addresses have lower dispersion. When the search element has nonuniform access memory storage, the Fibonacci search algorithm reduces the average time needed for accessing a storage location.</font><br><br><center><a href="8.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a></center></font></b></body></html>
