What is Huffman's algorithm?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is used in creating extended binary trees that have minimum weighted path lengths from the given weights. It makes use of a table that contains frequency of occurrence for each data element.</font><br><br>42. What is Fibonacci search?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is a search algorithm that applies to a sorted array. It uses divide and conquer approach that reduces the time needed to reach the target element.</font><br><br>43. Which data structure is applied when dealing with a recursive function?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A recursive function is a function that calls itself based on a terminating condition. It uses stack. Using LIFO, a call to a recursive function saves the return address. This tells the return address to the calling function after the call terminates.</font><br><br>44. How does dynamic memory allocation help in managing data?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Dynamic memory allocation helps to store simple structured data types. It can combine separately allocated structured blocks to form composite structures that expand and contract as required.</font><br><br>45. What is a bubble sort and how do you perform it?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Bubble sort is a sorting technique which can be applied to data structures like arrays. Here, the adjacent values are compared and their positions are exchanged if they are out of order. The smaller value bubbles up to the top of the list, while the larger value sinks to the bottom.</font><br><br>46. How does variable declaration affect memory allocation?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The amount of memory to be allocated depends on the data type of the variable. An integer type variable is needs 32 bits of memory storage to be reserved.</font><br><br>47. You want to insert a new item in a binary search tree. How would you do it?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Let us assume that the you want to insert is unique. First of all, check if the tree is empty. If it is empty, you can insert the new item in the root node. If it is not empty, refer to the new item's key. If the data to be entered is smaller than the root�s key, insert it into the root�s left subtree. Otherwise, insert it into the root�s right subtree.</font><br><br>48. Why is the isEmpty() member method called?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The isEmpty() member method is called during the dequeue process. It helps in ascertaining if there exists any item in the queue which needs to be removed. This method is called by the dequeue() method before returning the front element.</font><br><br>49. What is a queue ?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A Queue refers to a sequential organization of data. It is a FIFO type data structure in which an element is always inserted at the last position and any element is always removed from the first position.</font><br><br>50. What is adequeue?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A dequeue is a doubleended queue. The elements here can be inserted or removed from either end.</font><br><br><center><a href="4.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="6.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
