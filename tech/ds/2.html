List out few of the Application of tree data-structure?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. The manipulation of Arithmetic expression, 2. Symbol Table construction, 3. Syntax analysis.</font><br><br>12. List out few of the applications that make use of Multilinked Structures?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Sparse matrix, 2. Index</font><br><br>13. In tree construction which is the suitable efficient data structure?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Linked list is the suitable efficient data structure.<br>A linked list is a dynamic data structure. It consists of a sequence of data elements and a reference to the next record in the sequence. The order of linked items is different that of arrays. The insertion or deletion operations are constant in number.<br><br>The types of linked lists are:<br><u>Singly linked list:</u> It has only head part and corresponding references to the next nodes.<br><u>Doubly linked list:</u> A linked list which both head and tail parts, thus allowing the traversal in bi-directional fashion. Except the first node, the head node refers to the previous node.<br><u>Circular linked list:</u> A linked list whose last node has reference to the first node.<br><br><u>Steps to  sort a linked list:</u><br>Step 1: Compare the current node in the unsorted list with every element in the rest of the list. If the current element is more than any other element go to step 2 otherwise go to step 3.<br>Step 2: Position the element with higher value after the position of the current element. Compare the next element. Go to step1 if an element exists, else stop the process.<br>
Step 3: If the list is already in sorted order, insert the current node at the end of the list. Compare the next element, if any and go to step 1 or quit.</font><br><br>14. What is the type of the algorithm used in solving the 8 Queens problem?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Backtracking.</font><br><br>15. In an AVL tree, at what condition the balancing is to be done?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>If the 'pivotal value' (or the 'Height factor') is greater than 1 or less than -1.</font><br><br>16. What is the bucket size, when the overlapping and collision occur at same time?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>One. If there is only one entry possible in the bucket, when the collision occurs, there is no way to accommodate the colliding value. This results in the overlapping of values.</font><br><br>17. Classify the Hashing Functions based on the various methods by which the key value is found.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Direct method, 2. Subtraction method, 3. Modulo-Division method, 4. Digit-Extraction method, 5. Mid-Square method, 6. Folding method, 7. Pseudo-random method.</font><br><br>18. What are the types of Collision Resolution Techniques and the methods used in each of the type?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Open addressing (closed hashing), The methods used include: Overflow block. 2. Closed addressing (open hashing), The methods used include: Linked list, Binary tree.</font><br><br>19. In RDBMS, what is the efficient data structure used in the internal storage representation?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>B+ tree. Because in B+ tree, all the data is stored only in leaf nodes, that makes searching easier. This corresponds to the records that shall be stored in leaf nodes.</font><br><br>20. What is a spanning Tree?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A spanning tree is a tree associated with a network. All the nodes of the graph appear on the tree once. A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree organized so that the total edge weight between nodes is minimized.</font><br><br><center><a href="1.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="3.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
