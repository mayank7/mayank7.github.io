What are the difference between malloc() and calloc()?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Following are the main difference between malloc() and calloc(). calloc() function takes two parameters but malloc() function takes only one parameter. Memory allocated by calloc() is initialized to zero while memory allocated by malloc() contains garbage value.</font><br><br>32. How will you free the memory that is allocated at run time?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Memory is one of the most important resources and it is limited. The dynamically allocated memory is not automatically released; it will exist till the end of program. So it is programmer�s responsibility to free the memory after completion. The free() function is used to release the memory that is allocated at run time. Example: free(ptr); Here ptr is a pointer variable that contains the base address of a memory block created by malloc() or calloc() function.</font><br><br>33. What are different application of stack.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Some of the applications of stack are as follows: Function calls. Reversal of a string. Checking validity of an expression containing nested parenthesis. Conversion of infix expression to postfix.</font><br><br>34. How will you check the validity of an expression containing nested parentheses?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>One of the applications of stack is checking validity of an expression containing nested parenthesis. An expression will be valid if it satisfies the two conditions. The total number of left parenthesis should be equal to the total number of right parenthesis in the expression. For every right parenthesis there should be a left parenthesis of the same time. The procedure for checking validity of an expression containing nested parenthesis: 1. First take an empty stack 2. Scan the symbols of expression from left to right. 3. If the symbol is a left parenthesis then push it on the stack. 4. If the symbol is right parenthesis then If the stack is empty then the expression is invalid because Right parentheses are more than left parenthesis. else Pop an element from stack. 5. After scanning all the symbols of expression, if stack is empty then expression is valid else it is invalid because left parenthesis is more than right parenthesis.</font><br><br>35. Which data structure is used to perform recursion?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The data structure used for recursion is Stack. Its LIFO property helps it remembers its 'caller'. This helps it know the data which is to be returned when the function has to return. System stack is used for storing the return addresses of the function calls.</font><br><br>36. Does the Minimal Spanning tree of a graph give the shortest distance between any 2 specified nodes?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>No, it doesn�t. It assures that the total weight of the tree is kept to minimum. It doesn't imply that the distance between any two nodes involved in the minimumspanning tree is minimum.</font><br><br>37. If you are using C language to implement the heterogeneous linked list, what pointer type will you use?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A heterogeneous linked list contains different data types in its nodes. We can not use ordinary pointer to connect them. The pointer that we use in such a case is void pointer as it is a generic pointer type and capable of storing pointer to any type.</font><br><br>38. Differentiate between PUSH and POP?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Pushing and popping refers to the way data is stored into and retrieved from a stack. PUSH � Data being pushed/ added to the stack. POP Data being retrieved from the stack, particularly the topmost data.</font><br><br>39. When is a binary search algorithm best applied?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is best applied to search a list when the elements are already in order or sorted. The list here is searched starting in the middle. If that middle value is not the correct one, the lower or the upper half is searched in the similar way.</font><br><br>40. How do you reference all the elements in a onedimension array?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>This is done using an indexed loop. The counter runs from 0 to the array size minus one. Using the loop counter as the array subscript helps in referencing all the elements in onedimensional array.</font><br><br><center><a href="3.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="5.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
