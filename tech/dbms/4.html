What is Data Storage - Definition Language?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The storage structures and access methods used by database system are specified by a set of definition in a special type of DDL called data storage-definition language.</font><br><br>32. What is DML (Data Manipulation Language)?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>This language that enable user to access or manipulate data as organised by appropriate data model. 1. Procedural DML or Low level: DML requires a user to specify what data are needed and how to get those data. 2. Non-Procedural DML or High level: DML requires a user to specify what data are needed without specifying how to get those data.</font><br><br>33. What is DML Compiler?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It translates DML statements in a query language into low-level instruction that the query evaluation engine can understand.</font><br><br>34. What is Query evaluation engine?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It executes low-level instruction generated by compiler.</font><br><br>35. What is DDL Interpreter?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It interprets DDL statements and record them in tables containing metadata.</font><br><br>36. What is Record-at-a-time?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The Low level or Procedural DML can specify and retrieve each record from a set of records. This retrieve of a record is said to be Record-at-a-time.</font><br><br>37. What is Set-at-a-time or Set-oriented?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The High level or Non-procedural DML can specify and retrieve many records in a single DML statement. This retrieve of a record is said to be Set-at-a-time or Set-oriented.</font><br><br>38. What is Relational Algebra?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is procedural query language. It consists of a set of operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relation.</font><br><br>39. What is Relational Calculus?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is an applied predicate calculus specifically tailored for relational databases proposed by E.F. Codd. E.g. of languages based on it are DSL ALPHA, QUEL.</font><br><br>40. How does Tuple-oriented relational calculus differ from domain-oriented relational calculus?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. The tuple-oriented calculus uses a tuple variables i.e., variable whose only permitted values are tuples of that relation. E.g. QUEL 2. The domain-oriented calculus has domain variables i.e., variables that range over the underlying domains instead of over relation. E.g. ILL, DEDUCE.</font><br><br><center><a href="3.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="5.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
