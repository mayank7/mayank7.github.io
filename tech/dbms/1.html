What is database?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning, representing some aspect of real world and which is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.</font><br><br>2. What is DBMS?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is a collection of programs that enables user to create and maintain a database. In other words it is general-purpose software that provides the users with the processes of defining, constructing and manipulating the database for various applications.</font><br><br>3. What is a Database system?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The database and DBMS software together is called as Database system.</font><br><br>4. What are the advantages of DBMS?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Redundancy is controlled. 2. Unauthorised access is restricted. 3. Providing multiple user interfaces. 4. Enforcing integrity constraints. 5. Providing backup and recovery.</font><br><br>5. What are the disadvantage in File Processing System?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Data redundancy and inconsistency. 2. Difficult in accessing data. 3. Data isolation. 4. Data integrity. 5. Concurrent access is not possible. 6. Security Problems.</font><br><br>6. Describe the three levels of data abstraction?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The are three levels of abstraction: 1. Physical level: The lowest level of abstraction describes how data are stored. 2. Logical level: The next higher level of abstraction, describes what data are stored in database and what relationship among those data. 3. View level: The highest level of abstraction describes only part of entire database.</font><br><br>7. Define the "integrity rules"?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>There are two Integrity rules. 1. Entity Integrity: States that "Primary key cannot have NULL value" 2. Referential Integrity: States that "Foreign Key can be either a NULL value or should be Primary Key value of other relation.</font><br><br>8. What is extension and intension?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>1. Extension: It is the number of tuples present in a table at any instance. This is time dependent. 2. Intension: It is a constant value that gives the name, structure of table and the constraints laid on it.</font><br><br>9. What is System R? What are its two major subsystems?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>System R was designed and developed over a period of 1974-79 at IBM San Jose Research Center. It is a prototype and its purpose was to demonstrate that it is possible to build a Relational System that can be used in a real life environment to solve real life problems, with performance at least comparable to that of existing system. Its two subsystems are: 1. Research Storage 2. System Relational Data System.</font><br><br>10. How is the data structure of System R different from the relational structure?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>Unlike Relational systems in System R 1. Domains are not supported 2. Enforcement of candidate key uniqueness is optional 3. Enforcement of entity integrity is optional 4. Referential integrity is not enforced.</font><br><br><center><a href="2.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
