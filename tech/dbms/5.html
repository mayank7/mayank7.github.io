What is normalization?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is a process of analysing the given relation schemas based on their Functional Dependencies (FDs) and primary key to achieve the properties (1).Minimizing redundancy, (2). Minimizing insertion, deletion and update anomalies.</font><br><br>42. What is Functional Dependency?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A Functional dependency is denoted by X Y between two sets of attributes X and Y that are subsets of R specifies a constraint on the possible tuple that can form a relation state r of R. The constraint is for any two tuples t1 and t2 in r if t1[X] = t2[X] then they have t1[Y] = t2[Y]. This means the value of X component of a tuple uniquely determines the value of component Y.</font><br><br>43. What is Lossless join property?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It guarantees that the spurious tuple generation does not occur with respect to relation schemas after decomposition.</font><br><br>44. What is 1 NF (Normal Form)?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>The domain of attribute must include only atomic (simple, indivisible) values.</font><br><br>45. What is Fully Functional dependency?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>It is based on concept of full functional dependency. A functional dependency X Y is full functional dependency if removal of any attribute A from X means that the dependency does not hold any more.</font><br><br>46. What is 2NF?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A relation schema R is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and every non-prime attribute A in R is fully functionally dependent on primary key.</font><br><br>47. What is 3NF?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A relation schema R is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and for every FD X A either of the following is true 1. X is a Super-key of R. 2. A is a prime attribute of R. In other words, if every non prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on primary key.</font><br><br>48. What is BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A relation schema R is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and satisfies an additional constraint that for every FD X A, X must be a candidate key.</font><br><br>49. What is 4NF?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A relation schema R is said to be in 4NF if for every Multivalued dependency X Y that holds over R, one of following is true. 1.) X is subset or equal to (or) XY = R. 2.) X is a super key.</font><br><br>50. What is 5NF?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Answer:</u><br>A Relation schema R is said to be 5NF if for every join dependency {R1, R2, ..., Rn} that holds R, one the following is true 1.) Ri = R for some i. 2.) The join dependency is implied by the set of FD, over R in which the left side is key of R.</font><br><br><center><a href="4.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="6.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
