The fox cannot swim, and the duck cannot take flight from the water.<br>The fox is four times faster than the duck. Assuming the fox and duck pursue optimum strategies, is it possible for the duck to reach the edge of the pond and fly away without being eaten?<br>If so, how?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>From the speed of the fox it is obvious that duck cannot simply swim to the opposite side of the fox to escape.<br>Fox can travel 4r in the time duck covers r distance. Since fox have to travel half of the circumference Pi*r and Pi*r is less than 4r<br>So how could the duck make life most difficult for the fox? If the duck just tries to swim along a radius, the fox could just sit along that radius and the duck would continue to be trapped.<br>At a distance of r/4 from the center of the pond, the circumference of the pond is exactly four times the circumference of the ducks path.<br>Let the duck rotate around the pond in a circle of radius r/4. Now fox and duck will take exact same time to make a full circle. Now reduce the radius the duck is circling by a very small amount (Delta).<br>Now the Fox will lag behind, he cannot stay at a position as well. Say, the duck circles the pond at a distance r/4  e, where e is an infinitesimal amount.<br>So as the duck continues to swim along this radius, it would slowly gain some distance over the fox.<br>Once the duck is able to gain 180 degrees over the fox, the duck would have to cover a distance of 3r/4 + e to reach the edge of the pond.<br>In the meanwhile, the fox would have to cover half the circumference of the pond (i.e the 180 degrees). At that point,<br><br>(pi * r ) > 4 * (3r/4 + e)<br><br>So time taken to travel 3r/4 is quicker than 3.14*r at four times the speed.(0.14*r distance is left)<br>The duck would be able to make it to land and fly away.</font><br><br>32) You are given a choice of three doors by an Angel. You can choose only one of the doors among the three.<br>Out of these three doors two contains nothing and one has a jackpot. After you choose one of the doors angel reveals one of the other two doors behind which there is a nothing.<br>Angel gives you an opportunity to change the door or you can stick with your chosen door.<br>You dont know behind which door we have nothing. Should you switch or it doesnt matter?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>You choose one of the door. So probability of getting the jackpot  1/3.<br>Lets say that the jackpot is in Door no 1 and you choose Door no 1. So the angel will either open door no 2 or door no 3. Lets look at the sample space of this Puzzle.<br><br>Case -> Door1<br>Door2 Door3<br>Case 1 : Jackpot<br>Nothing Nothing<br>Case 2 : Nothing<br>Jackpot Nothing<br>Case 3 : Nothing<br>Nothing Jackpot<br><br><br>Lets suppose that you guessed correctly. Then it makes no difference what the game show host does, the other door is always the wrong door.<br>So in that case, by keeping your choice, the probability that you win is 1/3 x 1 = 1/3.<br>But lets suppose you guessed incorrectly. In that case, the remaining door is guaranteed to be the correct door. Thus, by keeping your choice, the probability of winning is 2/3 x 0 = 0.<br>Your total chances of winning by keeping your guess is: 1/3 + 0 = 1/3.<br>Again, lets suppose that you guessed correctly. By changing your guess the probability that you win is 1/3 x 0 = 0.<br>But lets suppose you guessed incorrectly. Again, this means that the remaining door must be the correct one.<br>Therefore by changing your choice, the probability of winning is 2/3 x 1 = 2/3.<br>Your total chances of winning by changing your guess is: 2/3 + 0 = 2/3.<br>Hence it is advisable to switch.</font><br><br><center><a href="set6.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a></center></font></b></body></html>
