Each ant starts randomly picks a direction and starts to move along the edge of the triangle. What is the probability that none of the ants collide?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>The ants can only avoid a collision if they all decide to move in the same direction (either clockwise or anti-clockwise).<br>If the ants do not pick the same direction, there will definitely be a collision.<br>Each ant has the option to either move clockwise or anti-clockwise. There is a one in two chance that an ant decides to pick a particular direction.<br>Using simple probability calculations, we can determine the probability of no collision.<br>P(No collision) = P(All ants go in a clockwise direction) + P( All ants go in an anti-clockwise direction) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25</font><br><br>2) A person dies, and he arrives at the gate to heaven.<br>There are 3 doors in the heaven. One of the door leads to heaven, second one leads to a 1-day stay at hell and then back to the gate and the third one leads to a 2 day stay at hell and then back to the gate.<br>Every time the person is back at the gate, the 3 doors are reshuffled. How long will it take the person to reach heaven?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>According to probability 1/3 of the time, the door to heaven will be chosen, so 1/3 of the time it will take 0 days.<br>1/3 of the time, the 1-day door is chosen, of those, the right door will be chosen the next day.<br>Similarly, 1/3 of the time, the 2 day door is chosen, of those, the right door will be chosen after the 2 days.<br>So lets say it will take N days. 1/3 of the cases are done in 0 days as before. 1/3 of the cases are 1+N. 1/3 are 2 + N.<br><br>N = 1/3 * 0 + 1/3 * (1 + N) + 1/3 * (2 + N)<br>N = 1 + 2N/3<br>Therefore, N/3 = 1 ; N = 3. So it will take on average 3 days to reach to heaven.</font><br><br>3) You have 3 jars that are all mislabeled. One jar contains Apple, another contains Oranges and the third jar contains a mixture of both Apple and Oranges.<br>You are allowed to pick as many fruits as you want from each jar to fix the labels on the jars.<br>What is the minimum number of fruits that you have to pick and from which jars to correctly label them?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Suppose you pick from jar labelled as Apple and Oranges and you got Apple from it. That means that jar should be Apple as it is incorrectly labelled.<br>So it has to be Apple jar. Now the jar labelled Oranges has to be Mixed as it cannot be the Oranges jar as they are wrongly labelled and the jar labelled Apple has to be Oranges.<br>Similar scenario applies if it�s a Oranges taken out from the jar labelled as Apple and Oranges.<br>So you need to pick just one fruit from the jar labelled as Apple and Oranges to correctly label the jars.</font><br><br>4) You have 8 balls. One of them is defective and weighs less than others. You have a balance to measure balls against each other. In 2 weighing, how do you find the defective one?<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Defective ball is light<br>Make three Groups G1 � 3 balls G2 � 3 balls G3 � 2 balls<br>First weight- G1 and G2 if G1 = G2 then defective ball is G3,<br>weigh the the 2 balls in G3 if EQUAL then 3rd ball of G3 is defective<br>else whichever lighter in 1st or 2nd is defective ball<br>else if G1 less than G2 defective ball in G1<br>weigh 1 and 2 ball of G1 if EQUAL then 3rd ball of G1 is defective<br>else whichever lighter in 1st or 2nd is defective ball<br>else if G1 > G2 defective in G2<br>Again in 1 comparison we can find the odd ball.<br><br>So by following above steps in 2 steps, lighter ball can be find out.</font><br><br>5) There are 13 caves arranged in a circle. There is a thief in one of the caves.<br>Each day the the thief can move to any one of adjacent cave or can stay in smae cave in which he was staying the previous day.<br>And each day, cops are allowed to enter any two caves of their choice.<br>What is the minimum number of days to guarantee in which cops can catch the thief?<br>Thief may or may not move to adjacent cave.<br><br>Cops can check any two caves, not necessarily be adjacent.<br><br><font color="�#000000�"><u>Soln:</u><br>Lets assume the thief is in cave C1 and going clockwise and cops start searching from cave C13 and C12 on your first day.<br>Cave C13 and C11 on second day,<br>C13 and C10 on third day and so on till C13 and C1 on 12th day.<br>So basically the aim is to check C13 everyday so that if thief tries to go anti clockwise you immediately catch it and if goes clockwise cops will catch him in maximum 12 days (this include the case where he remains in Cave C1).<br>So, the answer is 12.</font><br><br><center><a href="set2.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
