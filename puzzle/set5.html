One of the path leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell.<br>There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you dont know who is the honest one and who is the liar.<br>You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>The question you should ask is If I ask the other guard about which side leads to heaven, what would he answer?.<br>It should be fairly easy to see that irrespective of whom do you ask this question, you will always get an answer which leads to hell. So you can chose the other path to continue your journey to heaven.<br>Let us assume that the left door leads to heaven.<br>If you ask the guard which speaks truth about which path leads to heaven, as he speaks always the truth, he would say left.<br>Now that the liar , when he is asked what the other guard (truth teller)  would answer, he would definitely say right.<br>Similarly, if you ask the liar about which path leads to heaven, he would say right. As the truth teller speaks nothing but the truth, he would say right when he is asked what the other guard( liar )  would answer.<br>So in any case, you would end up having the path to hell as an answer. So you can chose the other path as a way to heaven.</font><br><br>22) You have 2 ball of each A,B,C colors and each color have 1 light and 1 heavy ball. All light balls are of same weight same goes for heavy.<br>Find out weight type of each ball in minimum chances. You can use a two sided balance system (not the electronic one).<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>You can check by taking 2 balls of same color. Now, comparing those balls with other balls but this will take 3 chances for each color type ball.<br>Answer is 2 chances.<br>So, Make a table for all conditions for all 6 balls that will help in understanding and solving this problem.<br><br>A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2<br><br>First weight A1,B1 and B2,C1 -> 3 cases equal ,left is heavy or left is light.<br><br>Case 1:<br>Equal, if equal weight simply B1,B2 will solve the problem.<br><br>Case 2:<br>Left is heavy that means B1 is heavy. A1 is heavy. B2 is light.<br>C1 may or may not be heavy. 2nd turn, weight C1 with B1 and you will know about each ball.<br><br>Case 3:<br>Left is light that means B1 is light. A1 is light. B2 is heavy.<br>C1 may or may not be heavy. 2nd turn, weight C1 with B1 and you will know about each ball.</font><br><br>23) The riddle is Nine BIT students were sitting in a classroom. Their professor wanted them to test. Next day the professor told all of his 9 students that he has 9 hats.<br>The hats either red or black color. He also added that he has at least one hat with red color and the no. of black hats is greater than the no. of red hats.<br>The professor keeps those hats on their heads and ask them tell me how many red and black hats the professor have?<br>Obviously students can not talk to each other or no written communication, or looking into each other eyes; no such stupid options and no tricks.<br>Professor goes out and comes back after 20 minutes but nobody was able to answer the question. So he gave them 10 more minuets but the result was the same.<br>So he decides to give them final 5 minutes. When he comes everybody was able to answer him correctly. So what is the answer and why?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>After first interval of 20 minutes :<br>Lets assume that their is 1 hat of red color and 8 hats of black color. The student with red hat on his head can see all 8 black hats, so he knows that he must be wearing a red hat.<br>Now we know that after first interval nobody was able to answer the prof that means our assumption is wrong. So there can not be 1 red and 8 black hats.<br><br>After second interval of 10 minutes :<br>Assume that their are 2 hats of red color and 7 hats of black color. The students with red hat on their head can see all 7 black hats and 1 red hat, so they know that they must be wearing a red hat.<br>Now we know that after second interval nobody was able to answer the prof that means our assumption is again wrong. So there can not be 2 red and 7 black hats.<br><br>After third interval of final 5 minutes :<br>Now assume that their is 3 hats of red color and 6 hats of black color. The students with red hat on their head can see all 6 black hats and 2 red hats, so they know that they must be wearing a red hat.<br>Now we know that this time everybody was able to answer the prof that means our assumption is right.So there are 3 red hats and 6 black hats.Now as everybody gave the answer so there can be a doubt that only those 3 students know about it how everybody came to know.<br>Then here is what i think, the professor gave them FINAL 5 minutes to answer, so other guys will think that the professor expects the answer after 3rd interval (according to prof it must be solved after 3 intervals), so this is the clue for others.</font><br><br>24) Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have only one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without one.<br>The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins.<br>What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>It is 17 mins.<br>1 and 2 go first, then 1 comes back. Then 7 and 10 go and 2 comes back.<br>Then 1 and 2 go again, it makes a total of 17 minutes.</font><br><br>25) Court takes decision to relax the sentence given to criminal if he can solve a puzzle. Criminal has to take decision to open one of the doors.<br>Behind each door is either a lady or a tiger. They may be both tigers, both ladies or one of each.<br>If the criminal opens a door to find a lady he will marry her and if he opens a door to find a tiger he will be eaten alive. Of course, the criminal would prefer to be married than eaten alive.<br>Each of the doors has a statement written on it. The statement on door one says, In this room there is a lady, and in the other room there is a tiger.<br>The statement on door two says,In one of these rooms there is a lady, and in one of these rooms there is a tiger.<br>The criminal is informed that one of the statements is true and one is false. Which door should the criminal open?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Criminal should open door number 2.<br>Lets assume statement on the first door is true then second statement will also be true(as there will be a lady in one door and a tiger in other door), but as we already know that only one statement can be true, so first statement can not be true.<br>Now if first statement is false, it implies these possible scenarios<br><br>Door 1 Door 2<br>Tiger Tiger<br>Lady Lady<br>Tiger Lady<br><br>But as second statement is true, so it means behind one of the door there is a lady and in other door there is a tiger so options with both lady and both tigers are ruled out and only third option remains valid, thus the criminal should choose door number 2.</font><br><br><center><a href="set4.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="set6.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
