You are allowed to touch the coins, but cant tell which way up they are by feel.<br>You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which.<br>How do you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Make 2 piles with equal number of coins. Now, flip all the coins in one of the pile.<br>How this will work? lets take an example.<br>So initially there are 5 heads, so suppose you divide it in 2 piles.<br><br>Case:<br>P1 : H H T T T<br>P2 : H H H T T<br><br>Now when P1 will be flipped<br>P1 : T T H H H<br>P1(Heads) = P2(Heads)<br><br>Another case:<br>P1 : H T T T T<br>P2 : H H H H T<br><br>Now when P1 will be flipped<br>P1 : H H H H T<br>P1(Heads) = P2(Heads)</font><br><br>17) A man has two ropes of varying thickness (Those two ropes are not identical, they arent the same density nor the same length nor the same width).<br>Each rope burns in 60 minutes. He actually wants to measure 45 mins. How can he measure 45 mins using only these two ropes.<br>He cant cut the one rope in half because the ropes are non-homogeneous and he cant be sure how long it will burn.<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>He will burn one of the rope at both the ends and the second rope at one end.<br>After half an hour, the first one burns completely and at this point of time, he will burn the other end of the second rope so now it will take 15 mins more to completely burn. So total time is 30+15 i.e. 45mins.</font><br><br>18) Two old friends, Jack and Bill, meet after a long time.<br>Jack: Hey, how are you man?<br>Bill: Not bad, got married and I have three kids now.<br>Jack: Thats awesome. How old are they?<br>Bill: The product of their ages is 72 and the sum of their ages is the same as your birth date.<br>Jack: Cool But I still dont know.<br>Bill: My eldest kid just started taking piano lessons.<br>Jack: Oh now I get it.<br><br>How old are Bills kids?<br><br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>To do it, first write down all the real possibilities that the number on that building might have been. Assuming integer ages one get get the following which equal 72 when multiplied:<br><br>2, 2, 18  sum = 22<br>2, 4, 9  sum = 15<br>2, 6, 6  sum = 14<br>2, 3, 12  sum = 17<br>3, 4, 6  sum = 13<br>3, 3, 8  sum = 14<br>1, 8, 9  sum = 18<br>1, 3, 24  sum = 28<br>1, 4, 18  sum = 23<br>1, 2, 36  sum = 39<br>1, 6, 12  sum = 19<br><br>The sum of their ages is the same as your birth date. That could be anything from 1 to 31 but the fact that Jack was unable to find out the ages, it means there are two or more combinations with the same sum.<br>From the choices above, only two of them are possible now. For any other number, the answer is unique and the Jack would have known after the second clue. So he asked for a third clue.<br>The clue that the eldest kid just started taking piano lessons is really just saying that there is an oldest, meaning that the younger two are not twins.<br><br>2, 6, 6  sum(2, 6, 6) = 14<br>3, 3, 8  sum(3, 3, 8 ) = 14<br><br>Hence, the answer is that the elder is 8 years old, and the younger two are both 3 years old. The answer is 3, 3 and 8.</font><br><br>19) Four glasses are placed on the corners of a square table. Some of the glasses are upright (up) and some upside-down (down).<br>A blindfolded person is seated next to the table and is required to re-arrange the glasses so that they are all up or all down, either arrangement being acceptable, which will be signalled by the ringing of a bell.<br>The glasses may be re-arranged in turns subject to the following rules. Any two glasses may be inspected in one turn and after feeling their orientation the person may reverse the orientation of either, neither or both glasses.<br>After each turn the table is rotated through a random angle. The puzzle is to devise an algorithm which allows the blindfolded person to ensure that all glasses have the same orientation (either up or down) in a finite number of turns.<br>The algorithm must be non-stochastic i.e. it must not depend on luck.<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>On the first turn choose a diagonally opposite pair of glasses and turn both glasses up.<br>On the second turn choose two adjacent glasses. At least one will be up as a result of the previous step. If the other is down, turn it up as well.<br>If the bell does not ring then there are now three glasses up and one down(3U and 1D).<br>On the third turn choose a diagonally opposite pair of glasses. If one is down, turn it up and the bell will ring.<br>If both are up, turn one down. There are now two glasses down, and they must be adjacent.<br>On the fourth turn choose two adjacent glasses and reverse both. If both were in the same orientation then the bell will ring.<br>Otherwise there are now two glasses down and they must be diagonally opposite.<br>On the fifth turn choose a diagonally opposite pair of glasses and reverse both. The bell will ring for sure.</font><br><br>20) Youve got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay him.
