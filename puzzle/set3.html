A neighboring queen plots to kill the bad king and sends a servant to poison the wine.<br>Fortunately (or say unfortunately) the bad kings guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle.<br>Alas, the guards dont know which bottle but know that the poison is so strong that even if diluted 100,000 times it would still kill the king. Furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect.<br>The bad king decides he will get some of the prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the wine. Being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder no more than 10 prisoners  believing he can fob off such a low death rate  and will still be able to drink the rest of the wine (999 bottles) at his anniversary party in 5 weeks time.<br>Explain what is in mind of the king, how will he be able to do so ? (of course he has less then 1000 prisoners in his prisons).<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Think in terms of binary numbers.<br>Number the bottles 1 to 1000 and write the number in binary format.<br>bottle 1 = 0000000001 (10 digit binary)<br>bottle 2 = 0000000010<br>bottle 500 = 0111110100<br>bottle 1000 = 1111101000<br>Now take 10 prisoners and number them 1 to 10, now let prisoner 1 take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in its least significant bit.<br>Let prisoner 10 take a sip from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit. etc.<br>prisoner = 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br>bottle 924 = 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0<br><br>For instance, bottle no. 924 would be sipped by 10,9,8,5,4 and 3. That way if bottle no. 924 was the poisoned one, only those prisoners would die.<br>After four weeks, line the prisoners up in their bit order and read each living prisoner as a 0 bit and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit. The number that you get is the bottle of wine that was poisoned.<br>1000 is less than 1024 (2^10). If there were 1024 or more bottles of wine it would take more than 10 prisoners.</font><br><br>12) You have 20 Blue balls and 10 Red balls in a bag. You put your hand in the bag and take off two at a time. If theyre of the same color, you add a Blue ball to the bag.<br>If theyre of different colors, you add a Red ball to the bag. What will be the color of the last ball left in the bag?<br>Assume you have a big supply of Blue and Red balls for this purpose. When you take the two balls out, you dont put them back in, so the number of balls in the bag keeps decreasing.<br>Once you tackle that, what if there are 20 blue balls and 11 red balls to start with?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>There can be 3 possible cases taking off 2 balls from bag.<br>a) If we take off 1 Red and 1 Blue, in fact we will take off 1 Blue<br>b) If we take off 2 Red, in fact we will take off 2 Red (and add 1 Blue)<br>c) If we take off 2 Blue, in fact we will take off 1 Blue<br><br>So In case of (a) or (c), we are only take off one Blue ball. Also, we always take off Red balls two by two.<br><br>1) 20 Blue, 10 Red balls<br>If there are 10 (even) number of Red balls, we can not have one single Red ball left in the bag, so the last ball will be Blue.<br><br>2) 20 Blue, 11 Red balls<br>Now as the no. of Red balls is odd, there will be one single Red ball in the bag with other Blue balls, and whenever we remove 1 Red and 1 Blue ball, we end up taking off only the Blue ball. So the Red ball will be the last ball in the bag.</font><br><br>13) Three men  Sam, Cam and Laurie  are married to Carrie, Billy and Tina, but not necessarily in the same order. Sams wife and Billys Husband play Carrie and Tinas husband at bridge.<br>No wife partners her husband and Cam does not play bridge. Who is married to Cam?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Carrie is married to Cam.<br>Sams wife and Billys Husband play Carrie and Tinas husband at bridge.<br>It means that Sam is not married to either Billy or Carrie.<br>Thus, Sam is married to Tina. As Cam does not play bridge, Billys husband must be Laurie.<br>Hence, Carrie is married to Cam.</font><br><br>14) In a country where everyone wants a boy, each family continues having babies till they have a boy.<br>After some time, what is the proportion of boys to girls in the country? (Assuming probability of having a boy or a girl is the same)<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Half the couples have boys first, and stop. The rest have a girl. Of those, half have a boy second, and so on.<br>So suppose there are N couples. There will be N boys.<br><br>1/2 have a boy and stop: 0 girls<br>1/4 have a girl, then a boy: N/4 girls<br>1/8 have 2 girls, then a boy: 2*N/8 girls<br>1/16 have 3 girls, then a boy: 3*N/16 girls<br>1/32 have 4 girls, then a boy: 4*N/32 girls<br><br>Total: N boys and<br>1N 2N 3N 4N<br> +  +  +  + = ~N<br><br>Therefore, the proportion of boys to girls will be pretty close to 1:1</font><br><br>15) An engineer goes to a bank with a check of $200 and asks the cashier Give me some one-dollar bills, ten times as many twos and the balance in fives!.<br>What will the cashier do?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>The smallest amount of one-dollar and two-dollar bills the cashier may give to the old man is 11 + 102 = 21.<br>He must give the old man a multiple of 21 i.e. 21 or 42 or 63 or 84 or 105 or 126 or 147 or 168 or 187 without exceeding 200.<br>Out of all these numbers only 105 can be added to a multiple of 5 to sum up to make 200 altogether.<br>So he must give the balance of 95 in five-dollar bills.<br>Therefore, the cashier must give 5 one-dollar bills, 50 two-dollar bills and 19 five-dollar bills.</font><br><br><center><a href="set2.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="set4.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
