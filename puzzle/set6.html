One jar contains Apple, another contains Oranges and the third jar contains a mixture of both Apple and Oranges.<br>You are allowed to pick as many fruits as you want from each jar to fix the labels on the jars.<br>What is the minimum number of fruits that you have to pick and from which jars to correctly label them?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Suppose you pick from jar labelled as Apple and Oranges and you got Apple from it. That means that jar should be Apple as it is incorrectly labelled.<br>So it has to be Apple jar. Now the jar labelled Oranges has to be Mixed as it cannot be the Oranges jar as they are wrongly labelled and the jar labelled Apple has to be Oranges.<br>Similar scenario applies if its a Oranges taken out from the jar labelled as Apple and Oranges.<br>So you need to pick just one fruit from the jar labelled as Apple and Oranges to correctly label the jars.</font><br><br>27) A person goes to a bank with a check of $200 and asks the cashier Give me some one-dollar bills, ten times as many twos and the balance in fives!.<br>What will the cashier do?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>The smallest amount of one-dollar and two-dollar bills the cashier may give to the old man is 1x1 + 10x2 = 21.<br>He must give the old man a multiple of 21 i.e. 21 or 42 or 63 or 84 or 105 or 126 or 147 or 168 or 187 without exceeding 200.<br>Out of all these numbers only 105 can be added to a multiple of 5 to sum up to make 200 altogether.<br>So he must give the balance of 95 in five-dollar bills.<br>Therefore, the cashier must give 5 one-dollar bills, 50 two-dollar bills and 19 five-dollar bills.</font><br><br>28) A horse rider went a mile in 5 minutes with the wind and returned in 7 minutes against the wind. How fast could he ride a mile if there was no wind?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>Most of us will proceed like that if a rider goes a mile in 2 minutes with the wind, and returns against the wind in 3 minutes, that 2 and 3 equal 5, should give a correct average, so that time taken should be two and half minutes.<br>We find this answer to be incorrect, because the wind has helped him for only 2 minutes, while it has worked adversely for 3 minutes.<br>If he could ride a mile in 2 minutes with the wind, it is clear that he could go a 1.5 mile 3 minutes, and 1 mile in 3 minutes against the wind.<br>Therefore 2.5 miles in 6 minutes gives his actual speed, because the wind helped him just as much as it has retarded him, so his actual speed for a single mile without any wind would be (2.5)/6 = 5/12 miles/sec</font><br><br>29) Sailor Cat needs to bring a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across the river. The boat is tiny and can only carry one passenger at a time.<br>If he leaves the wolf and the goat alone together, the wolf will eat the goat. If he leaves the goat and the cabbage alone together, the goat will eat the cabbage.<br>How can he bring all three safely across the river?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>The trick to this puzzle is that you can keep wolf and cabbage together.<br>So the solution would be the sailor will start with the goat. He will go to the other side of the river with the goat. He will keep goat there and will return back and will take cabbage with him on the next turn.<br>When he reaches the other side he will keep the cabbage there and will take goat back with him.<br>Now we will take wolf and will keep the wolf at the other side of the river along with the cabbage. He will return back and will take goat along with him.<br>This way they all will cross the river.</font><br><br>30) Two trains enter a tunnel 200 miles long, traveling at 100 mph at the same time from opposite directions.<br>As soon as they enter the tunnel a supersonic bee flying at 1000 mph starts from one train and heads toward the other one.<br>As soon as it reaches the other one it turns around and heads back toward the first, going back and forth between the trains until the trains collide in a fiery explosion in the middle of the tunnel.<br>How far did the bee travel?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>The tunnel is 200 miles long. The trains meet in the middle traveling at 100 mph, so it takes them an hour to reach the middle.<br>The bee is traveling 1000 mph for an hour (since its flying the whole time the trains are racing toward one another)  so basically the bee goes 1000 miles.</font><br><br><center><a href="set5.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="set7.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
