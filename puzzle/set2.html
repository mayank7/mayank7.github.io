According to farmer the oldest son should get half of the horses,the middle son should get one third of the horses and the youngest son should get one ninth of the horses.<br>When their father died they were not able to divide the horses as the result was coming in fractions.<br>As the sons were fighting on how to divide the horses a traveling mathematician came and heard their problem.<br>He proposed a solution with which all the sons got their share in the property without harming any animal.<br>What was the advice given and how the group of horses were divided?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>We have 17 horses to be divided among three sons with the ratio as given.<br><br>1st son  half of the horses (17/2)=8.5<br>2nd son  one third of horses (17/3)=5.66<br>3rd son  one ninth of horses (17/9)=1.88<br><br>Now all the results are in fraction so the horses cannot be distributed like this.<br><br>He will add his horse to the group of horses. So in total we have 18 horses now. Now lets see the scenario again.<br><br>1st son  half of the horses (18/2)=9<br>2nd son  one third of horses (18/3)=6<br>3rd son  one ninth of horses (18/9)=2<br><br>So in total 17 horses will get distributed among the three sons and the traveling mathematician will take his horse and leave.</font><br><br>7) There are 25 horses and 5 lanes. You have no idea about which horse is better than other.<br>Find in minimum possible races, the first three fastest running horses.<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>We will have 5 races with all 25 horses<br>Let the results be<br>u1,u2,u3,u4,u5<br>v1,v2,v3,v4,v5<br>x1,x2,x3,x4,x5<br>y1,y2,y3,y4,y5<br>z1,z2,z3,z4,z5<br><br>Work through a process of elimination:<br><br>Where u1 faster than u2 , u2 faster than u3 etc and<br>We need to consider only the following set of horses<br>u1,u2,u3<br>v1,v2,v3<br>x1,x2,x3<br>y1,y2,y3<br>z1,z2,z3<br><br>Race 6<br>We race u1,v1,x1,y1,z1<br>Let speed(u1)>speed(v1)>speed(x1)>speed(y1)>speed(z1)<br><br>We get u1 as the fastest horse<br>We can ignore y1,y2,y3,z1,z2 and z3 automatically since those can not be in the top 3.<br><br>Now we left with<br>u2,u3,<br>v1,v2,v3,<br>x1,x2,x3,<br><br>Race 7<br>Race u2,u3,v1,v2 and x1 (x2,x3 is ignored since v1,x1 are faster than both, so obvious choices are u2,u3,v1,v2 and x1)<br>The first and second will be second and third of the whole set<br>So we need minimum of 7 races to find the 3 fastest horses.</font><br><br>8) You have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. you make 100 passes by the doors starting with the first door every time.<br>The first time through you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, you open it, if its open, you close it). the second time you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6).<br>The third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9), ec, until you only visit the 100th door.<br>What state are the doors in after the last pass? Which are open which are closed?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>You can figure out that for any given door, say door #38, you will visit it for every divisor it has. so has 1 & 38, 2 & 19.<br>so on pass 1 i will open the door, pass 2 i will close it, pass 19 open, pass 38 close.<br>For every pair of divisors the door will just end up back in its initial state. so you might think that every door will end up closed? well what about door #9. 9 has the divisors 1 & 9, 3 & 3.<br>But 3 is repeated because 9 is a perfect square, so you will only visit door #9, on pass 1, 3, and 9 leaving it open at the end.<br>Only perfect square doors will be open at the end.</font><br><br>9) There are 100 prisoners are in solitary cells, unable to see, speak or communicate in any way with each other.<br>Theres a central living room with one light bulb, the bulb is initially off.<br>No prisoner can see the light bulb from his own cell. Everyday, the warden picks a prisoner at random, and that prisoner goes to the central living room. While there, the prisoner can toggle the bulb if he wishes.<br>Also, the prisoner has the option of asserting the claim that all 100 prisoners have been to the living room. If this assertion is false (that is, some prisoners still havent been to the living room), all 100 prisoners will be shot for their stupidity.<br>However, if it is indeed true, all prisoners are set free. Thus, the assertion should only be made if the prisoner is 100% certain of its validity.<br>Before the random picking begins, the prisoners are allowed to get together to discuss a plan.<br>What plan should they agree on, so that eventually, someone will make a correct assertion?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>In evaluation of the problem, there is no limit on the number of times that a prisoner can go into the cell, however the prisoners need a way to communicate with each other on who when into the cell. Therefore one person is chosen as the counter.<br><br>Every time any prisoner is selected other than counter person , they follow these steps. If they have never turned on the light bulb before and the light bulb is off, they turn it on. If not, they dont do anything (simple as that).<br>Now if Counter person is selected and the light bulb is already on, he adds one to his count and turns off the bulb.<br>If the bulb is off, he just sits and do nothing. The day his count reaches 99, he calls the warden and tells him Every prisoner has been in the special room at least once.</font><br><br>10) There are 100 statements.<br>1st one says : at least one is wrong.<br>2nd one says : at least two are wrong.<br>3rd one says : at least three are wrong.<br>4th one says : at least four are wrong.<br>and so on.<br>100th one says : at least 100 are wrong.<br>How many statements are actually wrong and how many actually right ?<br><br><font color="#000000"><u>Soln:</u><br>100th statement is definitely wrong because it says at least 100 are wrong.<br>But if that is correct, then 100 statement itself cannot be right.<br>=> 100th statement is wrong and<br>=> 1st statement is correct.<br><br>99th statement cannot be correct because if it were correct,<br>then two statements would become correct (1st and 99th itself.)<br><br>But 99th statement says that atleast 99 are wrong.<br>=> 99th is wrong and<br>=> 2nd is correct.<br><br>calculating so on<br>50 statements are right (the first 50 ones) remaining 50 statements are wrong.</font><br><br><center><a href="set1.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="set3.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
