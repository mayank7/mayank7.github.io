I would like to share my experience .<br>There are totally 4 rounds which are aptitude which includes email writing ,followed by technical and managerial round and concluded with HR round. <br>The first round being aptitude, there was a hype that TCS aptitude is very difficult. <br>But i disagree , it was very basic. Coming to email writing , it is very basic and make sure you use all the words that they have mentioned without any spelling mistakes <br>. So if you are good enough u should get through . Coming to technical, it will be very basic . <br>I would suggest you to be thorough with basics of c,cpp,dbms . If ur lucky u will get these ..How ever i got to know that some were asked SE and CN also..so be prepared with basics. <br>I was asked to explain my project and as he liked it, he asked me to write the code.. <br>So i suggest u to know what is happening in the code atleast. If ur good with basics, you should go through easily. <br>Coming to managerial, this will be just a 1 on 1 conversation where they will ask you how you u would react in particular situations , <br>like you have been assigned a project that u dont know anything about and ur boss is very bad, what will u do..and u are assigned to learn somethin from ur subordinate.. will u ?<br> So staying positive and confident should get you through this as well.. <br>Next is the HR round which is just a formality where they ask are u willling to relocate and if you are aware of bond and such questions. <br>I found reading such experiences very helpful hence i thought i would upload mine as well so that it will help you guys also. <br>I can proudly tell that i got selected.<br><br><center><a href="19.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="21.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
