Aptitude. 2. Technical. 3. MR + HR . TCS <br>Aptitude: The new aptitude test will consist of 2 tests: 1. Letter Writing - I have been asked to write an email to Municipal officer explaining the disturbance caused due to building construction. <br>In this section minimum 70 words are required. But, I wrote up to 98 words.<br> Don't exceed 100 words in writing the E-mail. <br>2. Aptitude General - In this section I have attempted 24 among 30 which comprises of mainly <br>1. Work and time, <br>2. Geometry, <br>3. Time and Distance. <br>Next day the results for Aptitude round were out. 317 cleared the round. I am one among them. <br>In technical round I'm under Panel- 3. <br>TR: Tell me about Yourself? <br>Me: Gave brief description about me. <br>TR: Asked regarding my presentation topic NFC-Near Field Communication. <br>Me: I explained all the questions regarding the PPT. <br>TR: Why C++ doesn't provides security to the data. <br>Me: Sorry sir, I don't know. Actual Answer is: Even Friend function can access the private and protected members of a class. So, the data security is not good in C++. <br>TR: Can we use global variable declared in one program in another program? <br>Me: No sir, We can use only when the variable is declared as "Extern". <br>TR: what are the OOP concepts in C++ and explain? <br>Me: Explained. <br>TR: What is referential integrity constraint? <br>Me: While explaining he confused me many times by asking "Are you sure?". But I didn't lose confidence and explained clearly. <br>TR: Another person gave me a puzzle to solve it and said if you are done in solving this puzzle you are selected. (My heart beat increased and I am able to listen my heart beat). <br>Me: I solved it by taking 3 steps to solve the puzzle. But, <br>TR asked me to solve in 2 steps. I tried a lot, at last I failed in solving the puzzle in 2 steps due to tension. I came out of the room with no expectations. Our TPO told that the results of technical round will be announced by 10:30 PM. I haven't prepared for <br>HR round because of no hope. But luckily I was in the list of selected students of <br>HR round. There my happiness overloaded. Next day Morning MR+HR round started. I stood 13th in the list of Panel-2. My chance came at 05:30 PM. I entered room by greeting them and gave my resume. <br>HR: Write HTML Java script code for Library system. (Surprisingly he didn't asked me the famous question "Tell me about Yourself". ). (Actually I have attended HTML workshop in NIT-Warangal. So, by seeing Resume he asked the question). ME: I wrote the basic code using tags. <br>HR: tell me something about your project. <br>Me: explained continuously and he asked me to stop the flow. <br>HR: Suppose you got job in Microsoft offering 12 LPA and also in TCS offering 3. 2 LPA. Then what will you opt for? <br>Me: I told TCS and explained 4 reasons why I chosen TCS. But they are unsatisfied with my answers. They laughed at me actually, but I didn't loose hope. <br>HR: Apart from 2 years Bond Agreement, How many years you can give commitment for TCS. <br>Me: I remained silent for some time and told I can give commitment till my Retirement sir. (They laughed). <br>HR: Do you have any plans to do MS or M. TECH. ME: No sir, I want to get a job first. If my profession demands for Doing M. Tech, then I will complete M. Tech simultaneously working in TCS. <br>HR: Write the story of "NUVVU NAKU NACHAV" Telugu movie acted by Venkatesh. (I shocked). <br>Me: I wrote it on paper for 10 minutes, meanwhile <br>HR interviewed another person. After 10 minutes <br>HR called me and asked me to give the paper I wrote. Finally they were done up with me and said no more questions and said its over wait till announcement of result. 24 hours later the most awaiting result announced.<br> I'm proud to say that I am one among the selected students. Tips to you all: - Don't lose confidence at all. - They will mainly check you confidence and skills. <br> Be careful while attending an interview. - Be prepared, Dress professionally. - Hope this experience will help you.<br><br><center><a href="9.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="11.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
