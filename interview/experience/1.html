That's it, they don't check grammar.<br> So I would suggest that use very simple words to make simple sentences using those phrases and one more thing, type fastly and accurately, you won't get the feel of how ten minutes will fly away.<br>In the interview, first question I was asked whether I had done lunch or not. After that, I was asked to introduce myself. The interviewers didn't open my resume and based on my introduction they started asking questions from DBMS, about Normalization, different normal forms, joins, difference between primary, composite & candidate key. Then they asked about Deadlocks, how to remove it.<br>After that, they asked differences between C and Java, inline functions, friend function, difference between static and instance methods.<br>Then, about my project, its overall aspect, its security, its application in real world, which model used, described that model completely. Asked about my strong and weak points. I replied that my strong weak point and my weak point is same, I am very hard working and helpful. They smiled and asked 'How it was weak point', I said sometimes people use me for their benefits and I get easily used up to maintain my helpful nature.<br>Then asked about my hobbies and achievements, I described about the games I used to play and about the coding contests I participated, especially about Muphoria.<br>Then their common question "Why TCS ?", where would I see myself after joining TCS in 5 years ? What if I had to work on MS Excel only and no programming, no software development (This they asked because in my hobbies I had mentioned about other software applications I developed as I liked software building).<br>Then about my extra co-curricular activities, I mentioned IETE member, TPO member etc.<br>Then their final question, 'Anything you want to ask us', I asked what kind of work I will be assigned if fortunately I get selected. They replied that it depends on which domain/project I will be assigned.<br>And next day, I got to know that I was selected.<br><br><center><a href="2.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
