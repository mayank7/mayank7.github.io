There are four members and they asked me questions simultaneously before completing answering one question. <br>I think I was in the stress panel.They asked me to draw India map and Odisha map in it. <br>They all together asked me out of the world questions in Hr round. <br>They also told me something about some cities whose name also I don't know. <br>So my Hr round was gone very very bad. But my technical round is somewhat good. <br>And by the help of God I finally got selected in TCS. <br>So be prepared for some extra ordinary situations in HR round.<br><br><center><a href="16.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="18.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
