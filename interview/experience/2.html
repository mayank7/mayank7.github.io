But, we had to go through all the rounds, aptitude, case study, video screening and then interview, GD was skipped.<br>Aptitude part consisted of general questions from R.S. Agarwal and few verbal and reasoning questions, all total 30 questions.<br>In case study, we were given a marketing question.<br>Question: Being a member of marketing department of a electronics company, what survey you will conduct to optimize the profit of the company?<br>I replied that I would enquire about which products are in maximum sale, which product is the cheapest, product with maximum features, what features are being expected by the users, what is the price of similiar products of other companies etc etc.<br>In video screening, a video of 5-6 minutes from a movie was shown (Video was also about job interview) and we were asked to synthesize it not summarize it. Managed to do that.<br>Then after lunch, I was the first among four of us who was called for interview and I had to face four rounds of interview starting from 2 pm and finished at 5 pm. Others were lucky, they faced lesser rounds than me.<br>In first round, again a realtime situation, what will enquire about if I am a Bank manager and want to computerize my banking system.<br>Then I was asked some puzzles, questions from probablity.<br>In second round, algorithm based questions, pattern printing, about the software applications I developed as part of my hobby, their time and space complexities, about recursion when I explained about sudoku solving algorithm, data structure used for it, use of tree, graph, applications of binary tree in real time situations.<br>In third round I was asked questions from Java (I had mentioned in my resume).<br>
Starting from basic questions like setting Classpath, location of java.exe and other files present in that directory, their use, few questions from reflection API, then about Hashing, Hash function, then a series of questions from Collection Framework, HashSet, HashMap, then some question from JDBC also, which databases I have used to connect with a java program, I replied honestly i.e DB2, Oracle, MySQL & PostgreSQL only, which connection type I used and then some questions from my project also.<br>Final round was HR round, I was asked about MuPhoria experience, rate myself out of 10, about myself, my hobbies, my achievements, how I can contribute to Mu Sigma if I get selected, why not other software companies like TCS/Infosys etc, why analytics company etc etc.<br>The 3 hours of four continuous rounds of interview completely exhausted me.<br>After a week, I got the news that out of four of us, only three are selected and I and Vikash emerged successful.<br>All three of us felt disapponted for the fourth unselected guy, because he was still unplaced and we three already had one placement in our hand apart from Mu Sigma.<br><br><center><a href="1.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="3.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
