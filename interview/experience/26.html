Hello, please introduce yourself. <br>2. Explain the logic of Bubble sort and write a pseudo code for the algorithm. <br>3. Write a program to swap any given number. The interviewer swapped two statements that i wrote, and then asked the effect of swapping on the output thereafter.<br> 4. write a program to check if a given number/string is a palindrome or not.<br> 5. Concept of keys in DBMS.<br> 6. What is a function ? <br>You just need to be confident with what you say, and be clear with the logic of all the programs. <br>Within 5 minutes, you will be told whether you have cleared the TR or not. <br>If you are through, be 95% assured that you're going to get CTS now.<br> I got through the TR and my HR round went as follows :<br> 1. Hello, what is the meaning of your name ? Do you think you justify it ? <br>2. Tell me something about your family and academic life. <br>3. You have been in north India since your birth, what if we locate you to south ?<br> 4. What are your hobbies ? How have they benefited you ? <br>5. Why CTS ? <br>6. Any questions from your side ? (Be prepared to face this question in both the TR and HR rounds, better be prepared with a good question beforehand. <br>I asked him about a Cognizant approach, the "Two-in-a-box" idea.)<br><br><center><a href="25.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="27.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
