So do not attempt the questions you are not confirm about. <br>Now, comes the technical interview... it was basically surrounded to these areas- final year project, summer training and as I am from Electronics field few questions were based on my fav. subject and a few from c language as i mentioned c only in my resume. <br>after my interview finished and i came out i was pretty confident about the selection in the techinterview. <br>Now, comes the HR interview: <br>questions were related to general issues, role of it in social media, justification on strengths, tell me in 3 words how your friends would describe you, an idea you could present for the welfare of society.<br> And finally interviews finished and my name was called out among the few odd students selected. <br>practice as many questions you can twice thrice as many times coz the questions might repeat or digits might also get changed but questions are almost same.<br>. Be confident..<br> coz its the biggest strength.. <br>do not panic in the interviews.<br><br><center><a href="14.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="16.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
