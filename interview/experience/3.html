Clock related problem. <br>I had prepared it from RS Aggarwal book and Arun Sharma. Results were announced on that day and total 376 cleared the exam. We were informed that on 23rd Sept we will be having interview round. On 23rd, reporting time was at 11 AM. <br>There were 12-15 panels all over the 5th floor of TIG building. My name was announced at 4.10 pm for technical cum HR round. The panel had a tech person and one HR. <br>Me: Good afternoon sir <br>TR: Good afternoon Sit down. <br>TR: Introduce yourself. <br>Me: told. <br>TR: Write a program to generate Fibonacci series. <br>Me: wrote. *he checked the function part mainly.* <br>TR: what is the difference between procedural and object oriented language? <br>Me: told. 3 differences. <br>TR: Do you know linked list? <br>Me: yes, sir. <br>TR: what is it? <br>Me: told. <br>TR: Procedure to insert an element in any position in linked list. <br>Me: told. *only procedure, no coding* <br>TR: Name of few sorting algorithms. <br>Me: told. <br>TR: Describe Radix Sort. <br>Me: told. <br>TR: Can you write the code? <br>Me: I can try, sir. After writing 3-4 lines he stopped me. <br>TR: So, you have done a project on Java. So, can you tell me what the technology you have used is? <br>Me: told. Fact is that I prepared my project very well. I was in a position that whatever question he would have asked me I could have easily answered. But after this question it was my bad luck not a single question was asked to me from project. <br>TR: So, DBMS is also one of your favorite subjects. <br>Me: Yes, sir. <br>TR: What is data & what is DBMS? <br>Me: told. <br>TR: Well, what is RDBMS? Difference between DBMS and RDMS? <br>Me: told. <br>TR: Can you write a query. <br>Me: I'll try, sir. *then he gave me a simple query something like this. Find out the user name whose mob no starts with '94'. It was an easy one.* <br>TR: So, you have attended a workshop on Android. <br>Me: Yes, sir. One year ago. <br>TR: what is Android? <br>Me: told. <br>TR: 1 advantage and 1 disadvantage of Android. <br>Me: disadvantage I couldn't tell. <br>TR: Well, tell me something about Android activity. <br>Me: explained by making a diagram. While explaining he confused me by asking "Are you sure?" many times. *My advice is that don't lose confidence. If you don't know anything, tell them you don't know. Otherwise explain clearly* <br>TR: ok, my part is done. You(HR) can continue. Next the HR guy asked me few questions like 1. Why TCS? 2. Tell me about your family. 3. Why not business? (Because my father and elder brother are doing business.) 4. The movie you've recently watched? How was it? HR: Ok, do you have any question? <br>Me: Thanks for giving me this opportunity. I'd like to know what are the things I need to improve. <br>HR: Explained. <br>Me: Thank you, Sir. <br>HR: ok, you may go now and wait for the next round. Next again there was an HR cum MR round after 2 hours. <br>It was all about TCS bond and background check, whether there is any backlog or not, relocation and night shift (Always say YES) etc. <br>Few questions were like this:<br> 1. CEO of TCS. <br>2. Any problem on relocation? <br>3. What are the bad things you've heard about TCS? <br>4. Do you know any recent project of TCS? <br>HR: Ok, you may go now. Good Night. And happy Durga Puja. Enjoy. *while handshaking* <br>This round was purely for testing the communication skills and interest of the students. The only need in the HR round is to be confident and fluent in whatever you say.<br> Clarity in speech is necessary. 72 hours later the most awaiting result announced and 262 students from our college were selected. <br>And fortunately I'm one of them. So friends nothing to worry about just give your best shot and please don't fake it, try to be honest and then everything gonna be right.<br><br><center><a href="2.html"><font color="#E60000">Previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="4.html"><font color="#E60000">Next</a></center></font></b></body></html>
